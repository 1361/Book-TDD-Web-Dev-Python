Automating Deployment with Fabric

((("deployment", "automating with Fabric", id="Dfarbric11")))Automating deployment is critical for our staging tests to mean anything.
By making sure the deployment procedure is repeatable, we give ourselves
assurances that everything will go well when we deploy to production.



((("Fabric", "installation and setup")))Fabric is a tool which lets you automate commands that you want to run on
servers.  "fabric3" is the Python 3 fork:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install fabric3*
----


TIP: It's safe to ignore any errors that say "failed building wheel" during
    the fabric3 installation, as long as it says "Successfully installed..."
    at the end.


The usual setup is to have a file called 'fabfile.py', which will
contain one or more functions that can later be invoked from a command-line
tool called `fab`, like this:

[role="skipme"]
----
fab function_name:host=SERVER_ADDRESS
----

That will call `function_name`, passing in a connection to the server at
`SERVER_ADDRESS`.  There are lots of other options for specifying usernames and
passwords, which you can find out about using `fab --help`.


Breakdown of a Fabric Script for Our Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The best way to see how it works is with an example.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/bluepeter/valpetejohn/trivia.shtml[Here's one
I made earlier], automating all the deployment steps we've been going through.
The main function is called `deploy`; that's the one we'll invoke from the
command line. It then calls out to several helper functions, which we'll build
together one by one, explaining as we go.


[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l001)
====
[source,python]
----
from fabric.contrib.files import append, exists, sed
from fabric.api import env, local, run
import random

REPO_URL = 'https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.git'  #<1>

def deploy():
    site_folder = f'/home/{env.user}/sites/{env.host}'  #<2><3>
    source_folder = site_folder + '/source'
    _create_directory_structure_if_necessary(site_folder)
    _get_latest_source(source_folder)
    _update_settings(source_folder, env.host)  #<2>
    _update_virtualenv(source_folder)
    _update_static_files(source_folder)
    _update_database(source_folder)
----
====

<1> You'll want to update the `REPO_URL` variable with the URL of your
    own Git repo on its code-sharing site.

<2> `env.host` will contain the address of the server we've specified at the 
    command line, e.g., 'superlists.ottg.eu'.

<3> `env.user` will contain the username you're using to log in to the server.


Hopefully each of those helper functions have fairly self-descriptive names.
Because any function in a fabfile can theoretically be invoked from the
command line, I've used the convention of a leading underscore to indicate
that they're not meant to be part of the "public API" of the fabfile. Let's
take a look at each one, in chronological order.


Creating the Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's how we build our directory structure, in a way that doesn't fall 
down if it already exists:

[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l002)
====
[source,python]
----
def _create_directory_structure_if_necessary(site_folder):
    for subfolder in ('database', 'static', 'virtualenv', 'source'):
        run(f'mkdir -p {site_folder}/{subfolder}')  #<1><2>
----
====

<1> `run` is the most common Fabric command.  It says "run this shell command
    on the server".  The `run` commands in this chapter will replicate many
    of the commands we did manually in the last two.

<2> `mkdir -p` is a useful flavour of `mkdir`, which is better in two ways: it 
    can create directories several levels deep, and it only creates them 
    if necessary.  So, `mkdir -p /tmp/foo/bar` will create the directory 'bar'
    but also its parent directory 'foo' if it needs to.  It also won't complain
    if 'bar' already 
    exists.footnote:[If you're wondering why we're building up paths manually
with f-strings instead of the `os.path.join` command we saw earlier, it's
because `path.join` will use backslashes if you run the script from Windows,
but we definitely want forward slashes on the server. That's a common gotcha!]


Pulling Down Our Source Code with Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Next we want to download the latest version of our source code to the server,
like we did with `git pull` in the previous chapters:

[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l003)
====
[source,python]
----
def _get_latest_source(source_folder):
    if exists(source_folder + '/.git'):  #<1>
        run(f'cd {source_folder} && git fetch')  #<2><3>
    else:
        run(f'git clone {REPO_URL} {source_folder}')  #<4>
    current_commit = local("git log -n 1 --format=%H", capture=True)  #<5>
    run(f'cd {source_folder} && git reset --hard {current_commit}')  #<6>
----
====

<1> `exists` checks whether a directory or file already exists on the server.
    We look for the '.git' hidden folder to check whether the repo has already
    been cloned in that folder.

<2> Many commands start with a `cd` in order to set the current working
    directory. Fabric doesn't have any state, so it doesn't remember what
    directory you're in from one `run` to the next.footnote:[There is a Fabric
    "cd" command, but I figured it was one thing too many to add in this
    chapter.]

<3> `git fetch` inside an existing repository pulls down all the latest commits
    from the web (it's like `git pull`, but without immediately updating the
    live source tree).

<4> Alternatively we use `git clone` with the repo URL to bring down a fresh
    source tree.

<5> Fabric's `local` command runs a command on your local machine--it's just
    a wrapper around `subprocess.Popen` really, but it's quite convenient.
    Here we capture the output from that `git log` invocation to get the ID
    of the current commit that's on your local PC.  That means the server
    will end up with whatever code is currently checked out on your machine
    (as long as you've pushed it up to the server).

<6> We `reset --hard` to that commit, which will blow away any current changes
    in the server's code directory.

The end result of this is that we either do a `git clone` if it's a fresh
deploy, or we do a `git fetch + git reset --hard` if a previous version of
the code is already there; the equivalent of the `git pull` we used when we
did it manually, but with the `reset --hard` to force overwriting any local
changes.


NOTE: For this script to work, you need to have done a `git push` of your 
    current local commit, so that the server can pull it down and `reset` to
    it. If you see an error saying `Could not parse object`, try doing a `git
    push`.


Updating settings.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we update our settings file, to set the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `DEBUG`
variables, and to create a new `SECRET_KEY`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l004)
====
[source,python]
----
def _update_settings(source_folder, site_name):
    settings_path = source_folder + '/superlists/settings.py'
    sed(settings_path, "DEBUG = True", "DEBUG = False")  #<1>
    sed(settings_path,
        'ALLOWED_HOSTS =.+$',
        f'ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["{site_name}"]'  #<2>
    )
    secret_key_file = source_folder + '/superlists/secret_key.py'
    if not exists(secret_key_file):  #<3>
        chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)'
        key = ''.join(random.SystemRandom().choice(chars) for _ in range(50))
        append(secret_key_file, f'SECRET_KEY = "{key}"')
    append(settings_path, '\nfrom .secret_key import SECRET_KEY')  #<4><5>
----
====

<1> The Fabric `sed` command does a string substitution in a file; here it's
    changing `DEBUG` from `True` to `False`.  

<2> And here it is adjusting `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, using a regex to match the 
    right line.

<3> Django uses `SECRET_KEY` for some of its crypto--things like cookies and
    CSRF protection. It's good practice to make sure the secret key on the
    server is different from the one in your source code repo, because that
    code might be visible to strangers. This section will generate a new key to
    import into settings, if there isn't one there already (once you have a
    secret key, it should stay the same between deploys).  Find out more in the
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/signing/[Django docs].

<4> `append` just adds a line to the end of a file. (It's clever enough not to
    bother if the line is already there, but not clever enough to automatically
    add a newline if the file doesn't end in one. Hence the back-n.)

<5> I'm using a 'relative import' (`from .secret_key` instead of `from
    secret_key`) to be absolutely sure we're importing the local module,
    rather than one from somewhere else on `sys.path`. I'll talk a bit
    more about relative imports in the next chapter.
    
    
NOTE: Hacking the settings file like this is one way of changing configuration
    on the server.  Another common pattern is to use environment variables.
    We'll see that in <<chapter_server_side_debugging>>.  See which one you
    like best.


Updating the Virtualenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we create or update the virtualenv:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l005)
====
[source,python]
----
def _update_virtualenv(source_folder):
    virtualenv_folder = source_folder + '/../virtualenv'
    if not exists(virtualenv_folder + '/bin/pip'):  #<1>
        run(f'python3.6 -m venv {virtualenv_folder}')
    run(f'{virtualenv_folder}/bin/pip install -r {source_folder}/requirements.txt')  #<2>
----
====


<1> We look inside the virtualenv folder for the `pip` executable as a way of
    checking whether it already exists.

<2> Then we use `pip install -r` like we did earlier.


Updating static files is a single command:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l006)
====
[source,python]
----
def _update_static_files(source_folder):
    run(
        f'cd {source_folder}'  #<1>
        ' && ../virtualenv/bin/python manage.py collectstatic --noinput'  #<2>
    )
----
====

<1> You can split long strings across multiple lines like this in Python, they
    concatenate to a single string. It's a common source of bugs when what you
    actually wanted was a list of strings, but you forgot a comma!

<2> We use the virtualenv binaries folder whenever we need to run a Django 
    'manage.py' command, to make sure we get the virtualenv version of Django,
    not the system one.


Migrating the Database if Necessary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Finally, we update the database with `manage.py migrate`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l007)
====
[source,python]
----
def _update_database(source_folder):
    run(
        f'cd {source_folder}'
        ' && ../virtualenv/bin/python manage.py migrate --noinput'
    )
----
====

The `--noinput` removes any interactive yes/no confirmations that Fabric
would find hard to deal with.


And we're done!  Lots of new things to take in I imagine, but I hope you
can see how this is all replicating the work we did manually earlier, with
a bit of logic to make it work both for brand new deployments and for existing
ones that just need updating. If you like words with Latin roots, you might
describe it as 'idempotent', which means it has the same effect, whether you
run it once or multiple times.


Trying It Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's try it out on our existing staging site, and see it working to update
a deployment that already exists:


[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]

----

Awesome.  I love making computers spew out pages and pages of output like that
(in fact I find it hard to stop myself from making little \'70s computer __<brrp, brrrp, brrrp>__ noises like Mother in 'Alien').  If we look through it
we can see it is doing our bidding: the `mkdir -p` commands go through
happily, even though the directories already exist.  Next `git pull` pulls down
the couple of commits we just made.  The `sed` and `echo >>` modify our
'settings.py'. Then `pip install -r requirements.txt` completes happily,
noting that the existing virtualenv already has all the packages we need.
`collectstatic` also notices that the static files are all already there, and
finally the `migrate` completes without a hitch.



.Fabric Configuration
*******************************************************************************
If you are using an SSH key to log in, are storing it in the default location,
and are using the same username on the server as locally, then Fabric should
"just work".  If you aren't there are several tweaks you may need to apply
in order to get the `fab` command to do your bidding. They revolve around the
username, the location of the SSH key to use, or the password.

You can pass these in to Fabric at the command line.  Check out:

Or see the http://docs.fabfile.org[Fabric documentation] for more info.

'Brrp brrp brpp'. You can see the script follows a slightly different path,
doing a `git clone` to bring down a brand new repo instead of a `git pull`.
It also needs to set up a new virtualenv from scratch, including a fresh
install of pip and Django. The `collectstatic` actually creates new files this
time, and the `migrate` seems to have worked too.


Nginx and Gunicorn Config Using sed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




What else do we need to do to get our live site into production? We refer to
our provisioning notes, which tell us to use the template files to create our
Nginx virtual host and the Systemd service.  How about a little Unix
command-line magic?

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sed "s/SITENAME/superlists.ottg.eu/g" \
    source/deploy_tools/nginx.template.conf \
    | sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/superlists.ottg.eu*
----

`sed` ("stream editor") takes a stream of text and performs edits on it. It's
no accident that the Fabric string substitution command has the same name.  In
this case we ask it to substitute the string 'SITENAME' for the address of our
site, with the `s/replaceme/withthis/g`
syntax.footnote:[You might have seen nerdy people using this strange
s/change-this/to-this/ notation on the internet.  Now you know why!]
We pipe (`|`) the output of that to a root-user process (`sudo`), which uses
`tee` to write what's piped to it to a file, in this case the Nginx
sites-available virtualhost config file.

Next we activate that file with a symlink:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo ln -s ../sites-available/superlists.ottg.eu \
    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/superlists.ottg.eu*
----

And we write the Systemd service, with another `sed`:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server: *sed "s/SITENAME/superlists.ottg.eu/g" \
    source/deploy_tools/gunicorn-systemd.template.service \
    | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn-superlists.ottg.eu.service*
----

Finally we start both services:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl daemon-reload*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl reload nginx*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl enable gunicorn-superlists.ottg.eu*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl start gunicorn-superlists.ottg.eu*
----

And we take a look at our site: <<working-production-deploy>>.  It works,
hooray! 

[[working-production-deploy]]
.Brrp, brrp, brrp... it worked!
image::images/twp2_1101.png["A screenshot of the production site, working"]



It's done a good job.  Good fabfile, have a biscuit.  You have earned the
privilege of being added to the repo:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git add deploy_tools/fabfile.py*
$ *git commit -m "Add a fabfile for automated deploys"*
----


Git Tag the Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


One final bit of admin.  In order to preserve a historical marker,
we'll use Git tags to mark the state of the codebase that reflects
what's currently live on the server:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git tag LIVE*
$ *export TAG=$(date +DEPLOYED-%F/%H%M)*  # this generates a timestamp
$ *echo $TAG* # should show "DEPLOYED-" and then the timestamp
$ *git tag $TAG*
$ *git push origin LIVE $TAG* # pushes the tags up

Now it's easy, at any time, to check what the difference is between
our current codebase and what's live on the servers.  This will come
in useful in a few chapters, when we look at database migrations. Have
a look at the tag in the history:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git log --graph --oneline --decorate*
[...]
----


Anyway, you now have a live website!  Tell all your friends!  Tell your mum, if
no one else is interested!  And, in the next chapter, it's back to coding
again.

There's no such thing as the One True Way in deployment, and I'm no grizzled
expert in any case.  I've tried to set you off on a reasonably sane path, but
there's plenty of things you could do differently, and lots, lots more to learn
besides.  Here are some resources I used for inspiration:


* http://hynek.me/talks/python-deployments[Solid Python Deployments for Everybody] by Hynek Schlawack

* http://bit.ly/U6tUo5[Git-based fabric deployments are awesome] by Dan Bravender

  Greenfeld and Audrey Roy

For some ideas on how you might go about automating the provisioning step,
and an alternative to Fabric called Ansible, go check out <<appendix3>>.


.Automated Deployments
*******************************************************************************

Fabric::
    ((("automated deployment", "best practices for")))((("Fabric", "automated deployement best practices")))Fabric lets you run commands on servers from inside Python scripts. This
    is a great tool for automating server admin tasks.
    

Idempotency::
    If your deployment script is deploying to existing servers, you need to
    design them so that they work against a fresh installation 'and' against
    a server that's already configured.
    

Keep config files under source control::
    Make sure your only copy of a config file isn't on the server!  They
    are critical to your application, and should be under version control
    like anything else.

Automating provisioning::
    Ultimately, 'everything' should be automated, and that includes spinning up
    brand new servers and ensuring they have all the right software installed.
    This will involve interacting with the API of your hosting provider.

Configuration management tools::
    ((("configuration management tools")))((("Ansible")))((("Vagrant")))Fabric is very flexible, but its logic is still based on scripting. More
    advanced tools take a more "declarative" approach, and can make your life
    even easier.  Ansible and Vagrant are two worth checking out (see
    <<appendix3>>), but there are many more (Chef, Puppet, Salt, Juju...).((("", startref="Dfarbric11")))
