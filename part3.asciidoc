More advanced topics
====================

[partintro]
--
This may be called the advanced section, but it's full of really important 
topics for TDD and web development.
We'll be talking about how to integrate 3rd party systems, and
how to test them.  We'll cover mocking, which is a core part of TDD.  We'll
talk about server-side debugging, and test fixtures, and how to set up a
Continuous Integration environment.  All of these are vital in any web
development project.

Inevitably, the learning curve does get a little steeper in this section. You
may find yourself having to read things a couple of times before they sink in,
or you may find that things don't work first go, and that you need to do a bit
of debugging on your own.  Do persist with it!  There's lots of interesting
stuff in here.  And I'm always happy to help if you're stuck, just drop me
line.

I hope you've enjoyed the book so far. The best is yet to come, you'll see!
