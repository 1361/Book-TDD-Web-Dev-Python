This may be called the advanced section, but that doesn't mean you can 
skip it!  We'll be talking about how to integrate 3rd party systems, and
how to test them.  We'll cover mocking, which is a core part of TDD.  We'll
talk about server-side debugging, and test fixtures, and how to set up a
Continuous Integration environment.  All of these are vital in any web
development project.

I hope you've enjoyed the book so far, there's lots more fun to be had!
