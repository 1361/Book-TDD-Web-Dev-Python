Is all fun and game until you are need of put it in production.

((("deployment testing", id="ix_deptest", range="startofrange")))It's time to deploy the first version of our site and make it public.  They say
that if you wait until you feel ready to ship, then you've waited too long.

Is our site usable?  Is it better than nothing? Can we make lists on it? Yes,
yes, yes.

No, you can't log in yet.  No, you can't mark tasks as completed.  But do we
really need any of that stuff? Not really--and you can never be sure what
your users are 'actually' going to do with your site once they get their 
hands on it. We think our users want to use the site for to-do lists, but maybe
they actually want to use it to make "top 10 best fly-fishing spots" lists, for
which you don't need any kind of ``mark completed'' function. We won't know
until we put it out there.

In this chapter we're going to go through and actually deploy our site to a
real, live web server.  

You might be tempted to skip this chapter--there's lots of daunting stuff
in it, and maybe you think this isn't what you signed up for. But I 'strongly' 
urge you to give it a go.  This is one of the chapters I'm most pleased with,
and it's one that people often write to me saying they were really glad they
stuck through it. 

If you've never done a server deployment before, it will demystify a whole
world for you, and there's nothing like the feeling of seeing your site live on
the actual Internet. Give it a buzzword name like "DevOps" if that's what it
takes to convince you it's worth it.

NOTE: Why not ping me a note once your site is live on the web, and send me
the URL? It always gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling ...

TDD and the Danger Areas of Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying a site to a live web server can be a tricky topic.  Oft-heard is the
forlorn cryâ€”'``but it works on my machine'''.

((("deployment testing", "danger areas")))Some of the danger areas of deployment include:

Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)::
    ((("static files")))Web servers usually need special configuration for serving these.

The database:: 
    ((("database deployment issues")))There can be permissions and path issues, and we need to be careful about
    preserving data between deploys.

Dependencies:: 
    ((("dependencies, and deployment")))We need to make sure that the packages our software relies on are installed
    on the server, and have the correct versions.


But there are solutions to all of these.  In order:

- Using a 'staging site', on the same infrastructure as the production site,
  can help us test out our deployments and get things right before we go to the
  "real" site.((("staging sites")))

- We can also 'run our functional tests against the staging site'. That will
  reassure us that we have the right code and packages on the server, and
  since we now have a "smoke test" for our site layout, we'll know that the CSS
  is loaded correctly.((("functional test (FT)", "for staging sites")))

- 'Virtualenvs' are a useful tool for managing packages and dependencies
  on a machine that might be running more than one Python application.((("virtualenvs")))((("automation, in deployment")))((("scripts", "automated"))) 

- And finally, 'automation, automation, automation'.  By using an automated
  script to deploy new versions, and by using the same script to deploy to
  staging and production, we can reassure ourselves that staging is as much
  like live as
  possible.footnote:[What I'm calling a "staging" server, some people would
call a "development" server, and some others would also like to distinguish
"preproduction" servers.  Whatever we call it, the point is to have somewhere
we can try our code out in an environment that's as similar as possible to the
real production server.] 

Over the next few pages I'm going to go through 'a' deployment procedure.  It 
isn't meant to be the 'perfect' deployment procedure, so please don't take
it as being best practice, or a recommendation--it's meant to be an
illustration, to show the kinds of issues involved in deployment and where
testing fits in.

.Chapter Overview
*******************************************************************************
((("deployment testing", "overview")))There's lots of stuff in this chapter, so here's an overview to help you keep
your bearings:

. Adapt our FTs so they can run against a staging server.

. Spin up a server, install all the required software on it, and point our
  staging and live domains at it.

. Upload our code to the server using Git.

. Try and get a quick & dirty version of our site running on the staging domain
  using the Django dev server.

. Learn how to use a virtualenv to manage our project's Python dependencies on
  the server.

. As we go, we'll keep running our FT, to tell us what's working and what's
  not.

. Move from our quick & dirty version to a production-ready configuration,
  using Gunicorn, Upstart, and domain sockets.

. Once we have a working config, we'll write a script to automate the process
  we've just been through manually, so that we can deploy our site
  automatically in future.

. Finally we'll use this script to deploy the production version of our site
  on its real domain.
*******************************************************************************


As Always, Start with a Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("staging site", "functional tests (FT) for")))((("functional test (FT)", "adapting for staging site")))Let's adapt our functional tests slightly so that it can be run against
a staging site. We'll do it by slightly hacking an argument that is normally
used to change the address which the test's temporary server gets run on:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py (ch08l001)
[source,python]
----
import sys
[...]

class NewVisitorTest(StaticLiveServerCase):

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):  #<1>
        for arg in sys.argv:  #<2>
            if 'liveserver' in arg:  #<2>
                cls.server_url = 'http://' + arg.split('=')[1]  #<3>
                return  #<3>
        super().setUpClass()
        cls.server_url = cls.live_server_url

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        if cls.server_url == cls.live_server_url:
            super().tearDownClass()


    def setUp(self):
        [...]
----

OK, when I said slightly hacking, I meant seriously hacking. Do you remember I
said that `LiveServerTestCase` had certain limitations?  Well, one is that it
always assumes you want to use its own test server.  I still want to be able to
do that sometimes, but I also want to be able to selectively tell it not to
bother, and to use a real server instead. ((("unittest"))) 

<1> `setUpClass` is a similar method to `setUp`, also provided by `unittest`,
    which is used to do test setup for the whole class--that means it only
    gets executed once, rather than before every test method. This is where
    `LiveServerTestCase`/`StaticLiveServerCase` usually starts up its test
    server.  

<2> We look for the 'liveserver' command-line argument (which is found in
    `sys.argv`).

<3> If we find it, we tell our test class to skip the normal `setUpClass`, and
    just store away our staging server URL in a variable called `server_url`
    instead.

This means we also need to change the three places we used to use
`self.live_server_url`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py (ch08l002)
[source,python]
----
    def test_can_start_a_list_and_retrieve_it_later(self):
        # Edith has heard about a cool new online to-do app. She goes
        # to check out its homepage
        self.browser.get(self.server_url)
        [...]
        # Francis visits the home page.  There is no sign of Edith's
        # list
        self.browser.get(self.server_url)
        [...]

    def test_layout_and_styling(self):
        # Edith goes to the home page
        self.browser.get(self.server_url)
----

We test that our little hack hasn't broken anything by running the functional
tests "normally":

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests*] 
[...]
Ran 2 tests in 8.544s

OK
----

And now we can try them against our staging server URL.  I'm hosting my staging
server at 'superlists-staging.ottg.eu':


//would need to reset DNS each time for this test to work
[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=superlists-staging.ottg.eu*]

You can see that both tests are failing, as expected, since I haven't
actually set up my staging site yet. In fact, you can see from the
first traceback that the test is actually ending up on the home page of
my domain registrar.

((("commits", "staging site")))The FT seems to be testing the right things though, so let's commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # should show changes to functional_tests.py
$ *git commit -am "Hack FT runner to be able to test staging"*
----


Getting a Domain Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("deployment testing", "domain name for")))((("staging site", "domain name for")))((("domain names")))We're going to need a couple of domain names at this point in the book--they can both be subdomains of a single domain.  I'm going to use
'superlists.ottg.eu' and
'superlists-staging.ottg.eu'.
If you don't already own a domain, this is the time to register one! Again,
this is something I really want you to 'actually' do.  If you've never
registered a domain before, just pick any old registrar and buy a cheap one--it
should only cost you $5 or so, and you can even find free ones.
I promise seeing your site on a "real" web site will be a thrill.


Manually Provisioning a Server to Host Our Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("deployment testing", "manual provisioning for hosting", id="ix_deptestprov", range="startofrange")))((("hosting", "manual provisioning of server", id="ix_hostingmp", range="startofrange")))((("server", "manual provisioning for hosting", id="ix_servermp", range="startofrange")))((("provisioning", id="ix_provisioning", range="startofrange")))We can separate out "deployment" into two tasks:

- 'Provisioning' a new server to be able to host the code
- 'Deploying' a new version of the code to an existing server

Some people like to use a brand new server for every deployment--it's what we
do at PythonAnywhere.  That's only necessary for larger, more complex sites
though, or major changes to an existing site. For a simple site like ours, it
makes sense to separate the two tasks.  And, although we eventually want both
to be completely automated, we can probably live with a manual provisioning
system for now.

As you go through this chapter, you should be aware that provisioning is
something that varies a lot, and that as a result there are few universal
best practices for deployment.  So, rather than trying to remember the 
specifics of what I'm doing here, you should be trying to understand the
rationale, so that you can apply the same kind of thinking in the
specific future circumstances you encounter.


Choosing Where to Host Our Site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("hosting options")))There are loads of different solutions out there these days, but they broadly
fall into two camps:

- Running your own (possibly virtual) server
- Using a Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS) offering like Heroku, DotCloud,
  OpenShift, or PythonAnywhere

((("Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS)")))((("PaaS (Platform-As-A-Service)")))((("PythonAnywhere")))Particularly for small sites, a PaaS offers a lot of advantages, and I would
definitely recommend looking into them.  We're not going to use a PaaS in this
book however, for several reasons.  Firstly, I have a conflict of interest, in
that I think PythonAnywhere is the best, but then again I would say that
because I work there.  Secondly, all the PaaS offerings are quite different,
and the procedures to deploy to each vary a lot--learning about one doesn't
necessarily tell you about the others. Any one of them might change their
process radically, or simply go out of business by the time you get to read
this book.

Instead, we'll learn just a tiny bit of good old-fashioned server admin,
including SSH and web server config.  They're unlikely to ever go away, and
knowing a bit about them will get you some respect from all the grizzled
dinosaurs out there.

What I have done is to try and set up a server in such a way that it's a lot
like the environment you get from a PaaS, so you should be able to apply the
lessons we learn in the deployment section, no matter what provisioning
solution you choose.


Spinning Up a Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("server options")))((("Ubuntu")))I'm not going to dictate how you do this--whether you choose Amazon AWS,
Rackspace, Digital Ocean, your own server in your own data centre or a
Raspberry Pi in a cupboard behind the stairs, any solution should be fine, as
long as:

* Your server is running Ubuntu (13.04 or later).

* You have root access to it.

* It's on the public Internet.

* You can SSH into it.

I'm recommending Ubuntu as a distro because it has Python 3.4 and it has some
specific ways of configuring Nginx, which I'm going to make use of next.  If
you know what you're doing, you can probably get away with using something
else, but you're on your own.


NOTE: Some people get to this chapter, and are tempted to skip the domain bit,
and the "getting a real server" bit, and just use a VM on their own PC.  Don't
do this. It's 'not' the same, and you'll have more difficulty following the
instructions, which are complicated enough as it is.  If you're worried about
cost, dig around and you'll find free options for both. Email me if you need
further pointers, I'm always happy to help.


User Accounts, SSH, and Privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("nonroot user creation")))In these instructions, I'm assuming that you have a nonroot user account set
up that has "sudo" privileges, so whenever we need to do something that
requires root access, we use sudo, and I'm explicit about that in the various
instructions below. If you need to create a nonroot user, here's how:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
# these commands must be run as root
root@server:$ *useradd -m -s /bin/bash elspeth* # add user named elspeth 
# -m creates a home folder, -s sets elspeth to use bash by default
root@server:$ *usermod -a -G sudo elspeth* # add elspeth to the sudoers group
root@server:$ *passwd elspeth* # set password for elspeth
root@server:$ *su - elspeth* # switch-user to being elspeth!
elspeth@server:$ 
----

Name your own user whatever you like! I also recommend learning up how to use
((("private key authentication")))private key authentication rather than passwords for SSH.  It's a matter of
taking the public key from your own PC, and appending it to
'~/.ssh/authorized_keys' in the user account on the server. You probably went
through a similar procedure if you signed up for Bitbucket or Github.

There are some good instructions
https://library.linode.com/security/ssh-keys[here] (note that `ssh-keygen` 'is'
available as part of Git-Bash on Windows).

TIP: Look out for that `elspeth@server` in the command-line listings in this
chapter. It indicates commands that must be run on the server, as opposed to
commands you run on your own PC.


Installing Nginx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Nginx")))We'll need a web server, and all the cool kids are using Nginx these days,
so we will too.  Having fought with Apache for many years, I can tell
you it's a blessed relief in terms of the readability of its config files,
if nothing else!

Installing Nginx on my server was a matter of doing an `apt-get`, and I could
then see the default Nginx "Hello World" screen:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt-get install nginx*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo service nginx start*
----

(You may need to do an `apt-get update` and/or an `apt-get upgrade` first.)



You should be able to go to the IP address of your server, and see the
"Welcome to nginx" page at this point, as in <<nginx-it-works>>.

[[nginx-it-works]]
.Nginx--it works!
image::images/twdp_0801.png[The default "Welcome to nginx!" page]


If you don't see it, it may be because your firewall does not open port 80 to
the world. On AWS for example, you may need to configure the "security group"
for your server to open port 80.

While we've got root access, let's make sure the server has the key
pieces of software we need at the system level: Python, Git, pip, and virtualenv.

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt-get install git python3 python3-pip*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo pip3 install virtualenv*
----


Configuring Domains for Staging and Live
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("domain configuration")))We don't want to be messing about with IP addresses all the time, so we should
point our staging and live domains to the server. At my registrar, the control
screens looked a bit like <<registrar-control-screens>>.

[[registrar-control-screens]]
.Domain setup
image::images/twdp_0802.png[Registrar control screens for two domains]

In the DNS system, pointing a domain at a specific IP address is called an
"A-Record".  All registrars are slightly different, but a bit of clicking
around should get you to the right screen in yours.



Using the FT to Confirm the Domain Works and Nginx Is Running
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("functional test (FT)", "in provisioning")))((("provisioning", "functional tests (FT) in")))To confirm  this works, we can rerun our functional tests and see that their
failure messages have changed slightly--one of them in particular should
now mention Nginx:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=superlists-staging.ottg.eu*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: 'Unable to locate
element: {"method":"id","selector":"id_new_item"}' ; Stacktrace:
[...]
AssertionError: 'To-Do' not found in 'Welcome to nginx!'
----

Progress!(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_deptestprov")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_hostingmp")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_servermp")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_provisioning")))


Deploying Our Code Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to get a copy of the staging site up and running, just to
check whether we can get Nginx and Django to talk to each other.  As we do so,
we're starting to move into doing "deployment" rather than provisioning, so we
should be thinking about how we can automate the process, as we go.

NOTE: One rule of thumb for distinguishing provisioning from deployment is
that you tend to need root permissions for the former, but we don't for the
latter.((("provisioning", "vs. deployment")))((("deployment", "vs. provisioning")))

We need a directory for the source to live in.  Let's assume we have a home
folder for a nonroot user; in my case it would be at '/home/elspeth' (this is
likely to be the setup on any shared hosting system, but you should always run
your web apps as a nonroot user, in any case). I'm going to set up my
sites like this:

[role="skipme"]
----
/home/elspeth
â”œâ”€â”€ sites
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ www.live.my-website.com
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ database
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”‚     â””â”€â”€ db.sqlite3
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ source
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ manage.py
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ superlists
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ etc...
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”‚
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ static
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ base.css
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ etc...
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”‚
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â””â”€â”€ virtualenv
â”‚Â Â  â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚Â Â  â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ etc...
â”‚Â Â  â”‚
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ www.staging.my-website.com
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ database
â”‚Â Â  â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ etc...
----

Each site (staging, live, or any other website) has its own folder. Within that
we have a separate folder for the source code, the database, and the static
files.  The logic is that, while the source code might change from one version
of the site to the next, the database will stay the same.  The static folder
is in the same relative location, '../static', that we set up at the end of
the last chapter. Finally, the virtualenv gets its own subfolder too.  What's a
virtualenv, I hear you ask? We'll find out shortly.


Adjusting the Database Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("deployment", "adjusting database location")))((("database location")))First let's change the location of our database in 'settings.py', and make sure
we can get that working on our local PC.  Using `os.path.abspath` prevents any
later confusion about the current working directory:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch08l003)
[source,python]
----
# Build paths inside the project like this: os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ...)
import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
[...]

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '../database/db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
[...]

STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '../static')
----

Now let's try it locally:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mkdir ../database*
$ *python3 manage.py migrate --noinput*
Creating tables ...
[...]
$ *ls ../database/*
db.sqlite3
----

That seems to work.  Let's commit it:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # should show changes in settings.py
$ *git commit -am "move sqlite database outside of main source tree"*
----

To get our code onto the server, we'll use Git and go via one of the code
sharing sites.  If you haven't already, push your code up to GitHub, BitBucket,
or similar.  They all have excellent instructions for beginners on how to
do that.

((("Bash")))Here's some bash commands that will set this all up. If you're not familiar
with it, note the `export` command which lets me set up a "local variable"
in bash:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *export SITENAME=superlists-staging.ottg.eu*
elspeth@server:$ *mkdir -p \~/sites/$SITENAME/database*
elspeth@server:$ *mkdir -p \~/sites/$SITENAME/static*
elspeth@server:$ *mkdir -p \~/sites/$SITENAME/virtualenv*
# you should replace the URL in the next line with the URL for your own repo
elspeth@server:$ *git clone https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.git \
~/sites/$SITENAME/source*
Resolving deltas: 100% [...]
----

NOTE: A bash variable defined using `export` only lasts as long as that console
session. If you log out of the server and log back in again, you'll need to
redefine it. It's devious because Bash won't error, it will just substitute
the empty string for the variable, which will lead to weird results ... if in
doubt, do a quick *`echo $SITENAME`*.

Now we've got the site installed, let's just try running the dev server--this
is a smoke test, to see if all the moving parts are connected:

[role="skipme"]
[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ $ *cd ~/sites/$SITENAME/source*
$ *python3 manage.py runserver*
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "manage.py", line 8, in <module>
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

Ah. Django isn't installed on the server.

Creating a Virtualenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Django", "and virtualenvs", id="ix_Djangovirtenvs", range="startofrange")))((("deployment", "virtualenvs", id="ix_deployvirtenvs", range="startofrange")))We could install it at this point, but that would leave us with a problem:  if
we ever wanted to upgrade Django when a new version comes out, it would be
impossible to test the staging site with a different version from live.
Similarly, if there are other users on the server, we'd all be forced to use
the same version of Django.

((("virtualenvs", id="ix_virtualenv", range="startofrange")))The solution is a "virtualenv"â€”a neat way of having different versions of
Python packages installed in different places, in their own "virtual
environments".

Let's try it out locally, on our own PC first:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip3 install virtualenv* # will need a sudo on linux/macos.
----

We'll follow the same folder structure as we're planning for the server:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *virtualenv --python=python3 ../virtualenv*
$ *ls ../virtualenv/*
bin  include  lib
----


That will create a folder at '../virtualenv' which will contain its own
copy of Python and `pip`, as well as a location to install Python packages
to.  It's a self-contained ``virtual'' Python environment.  To start using
it, we run a script called `activate`, which will change the system path
and the Python path in such a way as to use the virtualenv's executables
and packages:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *which python3*
/usr/bin/python3
$ *source ../virtualenv/bin/activate*
$ *which python*  # note switch to virtualenv Python
/workspace/virtualenv/bin/python
(virtualenv)$ *python3 manage.py test lists*
[...]
ImportError: No module named \'django'
----

NOTE: It's not required, but you might want to look into a tool called
`virtualenvwrapper` for managing virtualenvs on your own PC.


.Virtualenvs on Windows
*******************************************************************************
On Windows, things are slightly different. There are two main things to watch
out for:

* The 'virtualenv/bin' folder is called 'virtualenv/Scripts', so you should
  substitute that in as appropriate.

* When using Git-Bash, do not try and run %%activate.bat%%&mdash;it is written for
  the DOS shell.  Use `source ..\virtualenv\Scripts\activate`.  The `source` is
  important.

*******************************************************************************

We're seeing that `ImportError: No module named django` because Django isn't
installed inside the virtualenv.  So, we can install it, and see that it
ends up inside the virtualenv's 'site-packages' folder:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
(virtualenv)$ *pip install django==1.7*

OK
$ *ls ../virtualenv/lib/python3.4/site-packages/*
django                       pip                     setuptools
Django-1.7-py3.4.egg-info  pip-1.4.1-py3.4.egg-info  setuptools-0.9.8-py3.4.egg-info
easy_install.py              pkg_resources.py
_markerlib                   __pycache__
----

To "save" the list of packages we need in our virtualenv, and be able to
re-create it later, we create a 'requirements.txt' file, using `pip freeze`,
and add that to our repository:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
(virtualenv)$ *pip freeze > requirements.txt*
(virtualenv)$ *deactivate*
$ *cat requirements.txt*
Django==1.7
$ *git add requirements.txt*
$ *git commit -m"Add requirements.txt for virtualenv"*
----

NOTE: While Django 1.7 isn't quite out yet, you can use
    `pip install https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.7b1/tarball/`,
    and just add the URL instead of the "`Django==1.7`" to 'requirements.txt';
    pip is magic enough to figure that out.  Test it by doing a 
    *`pip install -r requirements.txt`* locally, and you should see pip 
    concluding everything is already installed.
//TODO: remove this once django is out

And now we do a `git push` to send our updates up to our code-sharing site:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git push*
----

And we can pull those changes down to the server, create a virtualenv on
the server, and use 'requirements.txt' along with `pip install -r` to
make the server virtualenv just like our local one:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *git pull*  # may ask you to do some git config first
elspeth@server:$ *virtualenv --python=python3 ../virtualenv/*

[...]
----

That looks like it's running happily.  We can Ctrl-C it for now.

Notice you don't have to use the `activate` to use the virtualenv.
Directly specifying the path to the virtualenv copies of `python` or
`pip` works too.  We'll use the direct paths on the server.


TIP: Most people like to create a virtualenv for a project as soon
as they start it.  I only waited until now because I wanted to keep
the first few chapters as simple as possible.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_virtualenvs")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_Djangovirtenvs")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_deployvirtenvs")))


Simple Nginx Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Nginx", id="ix_Nginx", range="startofrange")))((("deployment", "Nginx", id="ix_deploynginx", range="startofrange")))Next we create an Nginx config file to tell it to send requests for our staging
site along to Django. A minimal config looks like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.server: /etc/nginx/sites-available/superlists-staging.ottg.eu
[source,nginx]
----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name superlists-staging.ottg.eu;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    }
}
----

This config says it will only work for our staging domain, and will "proxy"
all requests to the local port 8000 where it expects to find Django
waiting to respond to requests.

I
savedfootnote:[Not sure how to edit a file on the server?  There's always vi,
which I'll keep encouraging you to learn a bit of. Alternatively, try the
relatively beginner-friendly `nano`. Note you'll also need to use `sudo`
because the file is in a system folder.]
this to a file called 'superlists-staging.ottg.eu'
inside '/etc/nginx/sites-available' folder, and then added it to the enabled
sites for the server by creating a symlink to it:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *echo $SITENAME* # check this still has our site in
superlists-staging.ottg.eu
elspeth@server:$ *sudo ln -s ../sites-available/$SITENAME \
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/$SITENAME*
elspeth@server:$ *ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled* # check our symlink is there
----

That's the Debian/Ubuntu preferred way of saving Nginx configurations--
the real config file in 'sites-available', and a symlink in 'sites-enabled';
the idea is that it makes it easier to switch sites on or off.

We also may as well remove the default "Welcome to nginx" config, to avoid any
confusion:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default*
----

And now to test it:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo service nginx reload*
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/python3 manage.py runserver*
----

NOTE: I also had to edit '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf' and uncomment a line saying
`server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;` to get my long domain name to work.  You 
may not have this problem; Nginx will warn you when you do a `reload` if it has
any trouble with its config files.

A quick visual inspection confirms--the site is up (<<staging-is-up>>)!

[[staging-is-up]]
.The staging site is up!

----

((("Django", "debug screen")))The tests are failing as soon as they try and submit a new item, because we
haven't set up the database. You'll probably have spotted the yellow Django
debug page (<<django-debug-screen>>) telling us as much as the tests went
through, or if you tried it manually.


[[django-debug-screen]]
.But the database isn't

NOTE: The tests saved us from potential embarrassment there.  The site 'looked'
fine when we loaded its front page.  If we'd been a little hasty, we might have
thought we were done, and it would have been the first users that discovered
that nasty Django DEBUG page.  Okay, slight exaggeration for effect, maybe we
'would' have checked, but what happens as the site gets bigger and more
complex? You can't check everything. The tests can.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_Nginx")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_deploynginx")))


Creating the Database with migrate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("migrate")))((("deployment", "migrate")))We run `migrate` using the `--noinput` argument to suppress the two little "are
you sure" prompts:

It's great to see the site up and running!  We might reward ourselves with a
well-earned tea break at this point, before moving on to the next section...

TIP: If you see a "502 - Bad Gateway", it's probably because you forgot to
restart the dev server with `manage.py runserver` after the `migrate`.

//IDEA: this could be a good place to pause and make a new chapter.


Getting to a Production-Ready Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("deployment", "production-ready", id="ix_deploymentprodready", range="startofrange")))We're at least reassured that the basic piping works, but we really can't be
using the Django dev server in production.  We also can't be relying on
manually starting it up with `runserver`.


Switching to Gunicorn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Gunicorn", id="ix_gunicorn", range="startofrange")))((("Django", "and Gunicorn")))Do you know why the Django mascot is a pony?  The story is that Django
comes with so many things you want: an ORM, all sorts of middleware,
the admin site ... "What else do you want, a pony?" Well, Gunicorn stands
for "Green Unicorn", which I guess is what you'd want next if you already
had a pony...

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/pip install gunicorn*
----

Gunicorn will need to know a path to a WSGI server, which is usually
a function called `application`.  Django provides one in 'superlists/wsgi.py':


[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/gunicorn superlists.wsgi:application*

If you now take a look at the site, you'll find the CSS is all broken, as in

((("functional test (FT)", "for layout and style")))And if we run the functional tests, you'll see they confirm that something
is wrong. The test for adding list items passes happily, but the test for 
layout + styling fails.  Good job tests!

$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=superlists-staging.ottg.eu*]
[...]
AssertionError: 125.0 != 512 within 3 delta
FAILED (failures=1)
----

The reason that the CSS is broken is that although the Django dev server will
serve static files magically for you, Gunicorn doesn't.  Now is the time to
tell Nginx to do it instead.


Getting Nginx to Serve Static Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Nginx", "static files and")))((("static files", "Nginx and")))First we run `collectstatic` to copy all the static files to a folder where 
Nginx can find them:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput*
elspeth@server:$ *ls ../static/*
base.css  bootstrap
----

Note that, again, instead of using the virtualenv `activate` command, we 
can use the direct path to the virtualenv's copy of Python instead.

Now we tell Nginx to start serving those static files for us:

[role="sourcecode"]
.server: /etc/nginx/sites-available/superlists-staging.ottg.eu
[source,nginx]
----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name superlists-staging.ottg.eu;

    location /static {
        alias /home/elspeth/sites/superlists-staging.ottg.eu/static;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    }
}
----

Reload Nginx and restart Gunicorn...

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo service nginx reload*
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/gunicorn superlists.wsgi:application*
----

And if we take another look at the site, things are looking much healthier. We
can rerun our FTs:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=superlists-staging.ottg.eu*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 10.718s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----


Switching to Using Unix Sockets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Unix sockets")))When we want to serve both staging and live, we can't have both servers trying
to use port 8000.  We could decide to allocate different ports, but that's a
bit arbitrary, and it would be dangerously easy to get it wrong and start
the staging server on the live port, or vice versa.

A better solution is to use Unix domain sockets--they're like files on disk,
but can be used by Nginx and Gunicorn to talk to each other.  We'll put our
sockets in '/tmp'.  Let's change the proxy settings in Nginx:

[role="sourcecode"]
.server: /etc/nginx/sites-available/superlists-staging.ottg.eu
[source,nginx]
----
[...]
    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/tmp/superlists-staging.ottg.eu.socket;
    }
}
----

`proxy_set_header` is used to make sure Gunicorn and Django know what domain
it's running on.  We need that for the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` security feature, which 
we're about to switch on.

Now we restart Gunicorn, but this time telling it to listen on a socket instead
of on the default port:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo service nginx reload*
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/gunicorn --bind \
    unix:/tmp/superlists-staging.ottg.eu.socket superlists.wsgi:application*
----


And again, we rerun the functional test again, to make sure things still pass:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=superlists-staging.ottg.eu*]
OK
----

A couple more steps!


Switching DEBUG to False and Setting ALLOWED_HOSTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Django", "debugging screen")))((("debugging")))((("ALLOWED_HOSTS")))Django's DEBUG mode is all very well for hacking about on your own server, but
leaving those pages full of tracebacks available
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/#debug[isn't secure].

You'll find the `DEBUG` setting at the top of 'settings.py'. When we set this
to `False`, we also need to set another setting called `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. This
was
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/#std:setting-ALLOWED_HOSTS[added
as a security feature] in Django 1.5.  Unfortunately it doesn't have a helpful
comment in the default 'settings.py', but we can add one ourselves.  Do this on
the server:

[role="sourcecode"]
.server: superlists/settings.py
[source,python]
----
# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
DEBUG = False

TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

# Needed when DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['superlists-staging.ottg.eu']
[...]
----

And, once again, we restart Gunicorn and run the FT to check things still work.

NOTE: Don't commit these changes on the server. At the moment this is just a 
hack to get things working, not a change we want to keep in our repo. In
general, to keep things simple, I'm only going to do Git commits from the local
PC, using `git push` and `git pull` when I need to sync them up to the server.



Using Upstart to Make Sure Gunicorn Starts on Boot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Upstart")))Our final step is to make sure that the server starts up gunicorn automatically
on boot, and reloads it automatically if it crashes.  On Ubuntu, the way to do
this is using Upstart:

[role="sourcecode"]
.server: /etc/init/gunicorn-superlists-staging.ottg.eu.conf
[source,bash]
----
description "Gunicorn server for superlists-staging.ottg.eu"

start on net-device-up  <1>
stop on shutdown

respawn  <2>

setuid elspeth <3>
chdir /home/elspeth/sites/superlists-staging.ottg.eu/source  <4>

exec ../virtualenv/bin/gunicorn \  <5>
    --bind unix:/tmp/superlists-staging.ottg.eu.socket \
    superlists.wsgi:application
----

Upstart is joyously simple to configure (especially if you've ever had the
dubious pleasure of writing an `init.d` script), and is fairly
self-explanatory. 

<1> `start on net-device-up` makes sure Gunicorn only runs once the server has
     connected up to the Internet.

<2> `respawn` will restart the process automatically if it crashes.

<3> `setuid` makes the process run as the "elspeth" user.

<4> `chdir` sets the working directory.

<5> `exec` is the actual process to execute.


Upstart scripts live in '/etc/init', and their names must end in '.conf'. 

Now we can start Gunicorn with the `start` command:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ sudo start gunicorn-superlists-staging.ottg.eu
----

And we can rerun the FTs to see that everything still works. You can even test
that the site comes back up if you reboot the server!



Saving Our Changes: Adding Gunicorn to Our requirements.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Back in the 'local' copy of your repo, we should add Gunicorn to the list
of packages we need in our virtualenvs:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *source ../virtualenv/bin/activate* # if necessary
(virtualenv)$ pip install gunicorn
(virtualenv)$ *pip freeze > requirements.txt*
(virtualenv)$ deactivate
$ *git commit -am "Add gunicorn to virtualenv requirements"*
$ *git push* 
----

(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_deploymentprodready")))NOTE: On Windows, at the time of writing, Gunicorn would pip install quite
happily, but it wouldn't actually work if you tried to use it.  Thankfully
we only ever run it on the server, so that's not a problem. And, Windows
support is
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11087682/does-gunicorn-run-on-windows[being
discussed]...



Automating
~~~~~~~~~~


((("deployment", "automating", id="ix_deployauto", range="startofrange")))((("provisioning", "overview")))((("deployment", "overview")))Let's recap our provisioning and deployment procedures:

Provisioning::
* Assume we have a user account and home folder
* `apt-get nginx git python-pip`
* `pip install virtualenv`
* Add Nginx config for virtual host
* Add Upstart job for Gunicorn


Deployment::
* Create directory structure in '~/sites'
* Pull down source code into folder named 'source'
* Start virtualenv in '../virtualenv'
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `manage.py migrate` for database
* `collectstatic` for static files
* Set DEBUG = False and ALLOWED_HOSTS in 'settings.py'
* Restart Gunicorn job
* Run FTs to check everything works


Assuming we're not ready to entirely automate our provisioning process, how
should we save the results of our investigation so far?  I would say that 
the Nginx and Upstart config files should probably be saved somewhere, in
a way that makes it easy to reuse them later.  Let's save them in a new
subfolder in our repo:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mkdir deploy_tools*
----


[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/nginx.template.conf
[source,nginx]
----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name SITENAME;

    location /static {
        alias /home/elspeth/sites/SITENAME/static;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/tmp/SITENAME.socket;
    }
}
----


[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/gunicorn-upstart.template.conf
[source,bash]
----
description "Gunicorn server for SITENAME"

start on net-device-up
stop on shutdown

respawn

setuid elspeth
chdir /home/elspeth/sites/SITENAME/source

exec ../virtualenv/bin/gunicorn \
    --bind unix:/tmp/SITENAME.socket \
    superlists.wsgi:application
----

Then it's easy for us to use those two files to generate
a new site, by doing a find & replace on  `SITENAME`.

For the rest, just keeping a few notes is OK. Why not keep
them in a file in the repo too?

.Test-Driving Server Configuration and Deployment 
*******************************************************************************

Tests take some of the uncertainty out of deployment::
    As developers, server administration is always "fun", by which I mean, a
    process full of uncertainty and surprises. My aim during this chapter was
    to show a functional test suite can take some of the uncertainty out of the
    process.  

Typical pain points--database, static files, dependencies, custom settings::
    The things that you need to keep an eye out on any deployment include
    your database configuration, static files, software dependencies, and
    custom settings that differ between development and production.  You'll
    need to think through each of these for your own deployments.

Tests allow us to experiment::
    Whenever we make a change to our server configuration, we can rerun the
    test suite, and be confident that everything works as well as it did
    before.  It allows us to experiment with our setup with less fear.

"Saving Your Progress"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("deployment", "saving progress")))Being able to run our FTs against a staging server can be very reassuring.
But, in most cases, you don't want to run your FTs against your "real" server.
In order to "save our work", and reassure ourselves that the production server
will work just as well as the real server, we need to make our deployment
process repeatable.

Automation is the answer, and it's the topic of the next chapter.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_deptest")))
