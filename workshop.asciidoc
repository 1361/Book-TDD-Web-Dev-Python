= WELCOME TO THE TEST-DRIVEN-DJANGO WORKSHOP
= Required installations
 - Python 3, Git Firefox
 - Django (`sudo pip3 install https://github.com/django/django/archive/stable/1.7.x.zip`)
 - Selenium (`sudo pip3 install selenium`)
Don't use a virtualenv unless you 'really' know what you're doing. USB keys have installers for everything.

* Handout: http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/static/tdd-workshop.zip (Also on USB key)
* If you're a *beginner*, makes sure you sit next to someone more experienced

= Checking it all works

    $ python3
    Python 3.x.x (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:52:16) 
    [...]
    >>> import django
    >>> print( django.get_version() )
    1.7c2
    >>> from selenium import webdriver
    >>> browser = webdriver.Firefox()  # will pop up a firefox window
    >>> browser.get('http://www.google.com')
    >>> print(browser.title)  # this should say "Google"
    Google
    >>> browser.quit()








Introduction
============

Who I am, and why should you listen to me?
------------------------------------------

    - recent convert, resolver, etc


Who knows what?
---------------

    - Python - anyone v. new to it?

    - Django - anyone never used it?

    - TDD - unittest
 
    - Selenium


Laptops, tools and working
--------------------------

    - who is on Windows? Mac? Linux? VM? headless?? (the last is bad)

    - who is using an IDE?





The Plan
--------

    - To run through the first few chapters of my book
        - building a To-Do lists app
        - but TDD all the way
        - similar content to official Django tutorial

    - Handout contains all the steps
        - Code listings
        - Commands
        - Expected output
        - I demo, then you have a go!

    - Pair programming
        - if you're up for it!

    - Outline
        - Chapter 1: First functional test with selenium, install Django
        - Chapter 2: Switch to `unittest`
        - Chapter 3: First unit test, url, view
        - Chapter 4: **Refactor**: switch to using templates
        - Chapter 5: Using the database
        - Chapter 6: Iterate towards "MVP"



Speed and questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - We go at the speed of the slowest person
    - Ask questions
    - when I say "does everyone get that", don't just nod!


>> all moved to main book repo
