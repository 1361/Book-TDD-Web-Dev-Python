Chapter 1 - A simple TDD example - the Roman Calculator
-------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to start with a simple example.  Everyone always uses the same one,
which is a Roman Numerals, but I'm going to give it a little twist, which is
that I'll try and use TDD to make a Roman numeral 'calculator' - not a Roman
Numeral converter.  Along the way, we'll discover something I thought was quite
cool too.
