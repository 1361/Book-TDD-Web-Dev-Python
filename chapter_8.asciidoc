Testing deployment using a staging site
---------------------------------------

It's time to deploy the first version of our site and make it public.  They say
that if you wait until you feel ready to ship, then you've waited too long.

Is our site usable?  Is it better than nothing? Can make lists on it? Yes, yes,
yes.

No, you can't log in yet.  No you can't mark tasks as completed.  But do we
really need any of that stuff? Not really -- and you can never be sure what
your users are 'actually' going to do with your site once they get their 
hands on it. We think our users want to use the site for to-do lists, but maybe
they actually want to use it to make "top 10 best fly-fishing spots" lists, for
which you don't need any kind of ``mark completed'' function. We won't know
until we put it out there.

In this chapter I'm going to go through and actually deploy my site to a real,
live web server.  You might be tempted to skip this bit, but I strongly 
encourage you to actually go through and do this too.  It's only by doing
these things that we learn all the little gotchas.  Give it a buzzword
name like "DevOps" if that's what it takes to convince you it's worth
learning.


TDD and the Danger Areas of deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying a site to a live web server can be a tricky topic.  Oft heard is the
forlorn cry -- '``but it works on my machine'''.

Some of the danger areas of deployment include:

- 'static files' (CSS, JavaScript, images etc): web servers usually need
  special configuration for serving these
- the 'database': there can be permissions and path issues, and we need to be
  careful about preserving data between deploys
- 'dependencies': we need to make sure that the packages our software relies
  on are installed on the server, and have the correct versions

But there are solutions to all of these.  In order:

- Using a 'staging site', on the same infrastructure as the production site,
  can help us test out our deployments and get things right before we go to the
  "real" site
- We can also 'run our functional tests against the staging site'. Since we
  now have a "smoke test" for our site layout, we'll know that the CSS is 
  loaded correctly.
- We can write a special 'test that checks the deploy process',
  for example making sure database data is preserved (later, we can talk about
  South + data migrations...)
- 'Virtualenvs' are a useful tool for managing packages and dependencies on a
  server that's not entirely under your own control
- And finally, automation, automation, automation.  By using an 'automated
  script' to deploy new versions, and by using the same script to deploy to
  staging and production, we can reassure ourselves that staging is as much
  like live as possible.


As always, start with a test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's adapt our functional tests slightly so that it can be run against
a staging site. We'll do it by slightly hacking an argument that is normally
used to change the address which the test's temporary server gets run on:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
[source,python]
----
class NewVisitorTest(LiveServerTestCase):

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        for arg in sys.argv:
            if 'liveserver' in arg:
                cls.server_url = 'http://' + arg.split('=')[1]
                return
        LiveServerTestCase.setUpClass()
        cls.server_url = cls.live_server_url

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        if cls.server_url == cls.live_server_url:
            LiveServerTestCase.tearDownClass()


    def setUp(self):
        [...]
----

OK, when I said slightly hacking, I meant seriously hacking. Do you remember I
said that `LiveServerTestCase` had certain limitations?  Well, one is that it
always assumes you want to use its own test server.  I still want to be able to
do that sometimes, but I also want to be able to selectively tell it not to
bother, and to use a real server instead.  

`setUpClass` is a similar method to `setUp`, also provided by `unittest`, which
is used to do test setup for the whole class. This is where `LiveServerTest`
usually starts up its test server.  We look for the 'liveserver' command-line
argument (which are found in `sys.argv`, and if we find it, we tell our test
class to skip the normal `setUpClass`, and just store away our staging server
URL in a variable called `server_url` instead.

This means we also need to change the three places we used to use
`self.live_server_url`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
[source,python]
----
    def test_can_start_a_list_and_retrieve_it_later(self):
        # Edith has heard about a cool new online to-do app. She goes
        # to check out its homepage
        self.browser.get(self.server_url)
        [...]
        # Francis visits the home page.  There is no sign of Edith's
        # list
        self.browser.get(self.server_url)
        [...]

    def test_layout_and_styling(self):
        # Edith goes to the home page
        self.browser.get(self.server_url)
----

We test that our little hack hasn't broken anything by running the functional
tests "normally":

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests*] 
[...]
Ran 2 tests in 8.544s

OK
----

And now we can try them against our staging server URL.  I'm hosting my staging
server at 'book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com':


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com*]

You can see that both tests are failing, as expected, since I haven't
actually set up my staging site yet. In fact, you can see from the
first traceback that the test is actually ending up on the home page of
my domain registrar.

Let's commit.

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # should show to functional_tests.py
$ *git commit -am"Hack FT runner to be able to test staging"
----

NOTE: We're going to need a couple of domain names at this point in the book -
they can both be subdomains of a single domain.  I'm going to use
'book-example.obeythetestinggoat.comm' and
'book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com'.
If you don't already own a domain, this is the time to register one! Again,
this is something I really want you to 'actually' do.  If you've never
registered a domain before, just pick any old registrar and buy a cheap one
- it should only cost you $5! And I promise seeing your site on a "real"
web site will be a thrill :-)


Manually provisioning a server to host our site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can separate out "deployment" into two tasks:
- 'provisioning' a new server to be able to host the code
- 'deploying' a new version of the code to an existing server.

Some people like to use a brand new server for every deployment -- it's what we
do at PythonAnywhere.  I think it's probably only necessary for larger, more 
complex sites though, or major changes to an existing site.

For a simple site like ours, it makes sense to separate the two tasks.  And, 
although we eventually want both to be completely automated, we can probably
live with a manual provisioning system for now.

As you go through this chapter, you should be aware that provisioning is
something that varies a lot, and that as a result there are few universal
best practices for deployment.  So, rather than trying to remember the 
specifics of what I'm doing here, you should be trying to understand the
rationale, so that you can apply the same kind of thinking in the
specific future circumstances you encounter.


Choosing where to host our site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are loads of different solutions out there these days, but they broadly
fall into two camps:

- running your own (possibly virtual) server
- using a Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS) offering like Heroku, DotCloud or PythonAnywhere

Particularly for small sites, a PaaS offers a lot of advantages, and I would
definitely recommend looking into them.  We're not going to use a PaaS in this
book however, for several reasons..  Firstly, I have a conflict of interest, in
that I obviously think PythonAnywhere is the best, but then again I would say
that.  Secondly, all the PaaS offerings are quite different, and the procedures
to deploy to each vary a lot -- learning about one doesn't tell you about the 
others... And any one of them might change their process radically, or simply
go out of business by the time you get to read this book.

Instead, we'll learn just a tiny bit of good old-fashioned server admin,
including SSH and web server config.  They're unlikely to ever go away, and
knowing a bit about them will get you some respect from all the grizzled
dinosaurs out there.

Spinning up a server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'm not going to dictate how you do this -- whether you choose Amazon AWS,
Rackspace, Digital Ocean, your own server in your own data centre or a
Raspberry Pi in a cupboard behind the stairs, I'm going to assume you've
managed to start up a server with some flavor of Linux on it, that it's on the
Internet, and that you can SSH into it.  I'd recommend Ubuntu as a distro,
because it has Python 2.7, and it has some specific ways of configuring 
Nginx which I'm going to make use of below.  If you know what you're doing,
you can probably get away with using something else.


Installing Nginx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We'll need a web server, and all the cool kids are using Nginx these days,
so let's use that.  Having fought with Apache for many years, I can tell
you it's a blessed relief in terms of the readability of its config files,
if nothing else!


////
TODO: switch to Arch?
////

Installing Nginx on my server was a matter of doing an `apt-get`, and I could
then see the default Nginx "Hello World" screen:

    apt-get install nginx

.Nginx - It works!
image::images/nginx_it_works.png[The default "Welcome to nginx!" page]


And in fact we can re-run our functional tests and see that their failure
messages have changed slightly

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com*]
[...]
NoSuchElementException: Message: u'Unable to locate element: {"method":"tag
name","selector":"input"}' ; Stacktrace: [...]
[...]
AssertionError: 'To-Do' not found in u'Welcome to nginx!'
----

Progress!  

While we've got root access, let's make sure the server has the three other
pieces of software we need at the system level: Git, pip and virtualenv

    apt-get install git
    apt-get install python-pip
    pip install virtualenv


Configuring domains for staging and live
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, we don't want to be messing about with IP addresses all the time, so we
should point our staging and live domains to the server. At my registrar, the
control screens looked a bit like this:

.Domain setup
image::images/domain_setup.png[Registrar control screens for two domains]

In the DNS system, pointing a domain at a specific IP address is called an
"A-Record".  All registrars are slightly different, but a bit of clicking around
should get you to the right screen in yours...

To check this works, you can visit each domain in turn and check that you now
see the Nginx "welcome" page.


Deploying our code manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to get a copy of the staging site up and running, just
to check whether we can get Nginx and Django to talk to each other.  As
we do so, we're starting to do some of what you'd call "deployment", as
well as provisioning, so we should be thinking about how we can automate the
process, as we go.

NOTE: One way of telling the difference between provisioning and deployment is
that you tend to need root permissions for the former, but we don't for the
latter.

We need a directory for the source to live in.  Let's assume we have a home
folder at '/home/harry' (this is likely to be the case on any shared hosting
system). I'm going to set up my sites like this:

----
/home/harry
├── sites
│   ├── www.live.my-website.com
│   │    ├── database
│   │    │     └── database.sqlite
│   │    ├── source
│   │    │    ├── manage.py
│   │    │    ├── superlists
│   │    │    ├── etc...
│   │    │    
│   │    ├── static
│   │    │    ├── base.css 
│   │    │    ├── etc...
│   │    │    
│   │    └── virtualenv
│   │         ├── lib
│   │         ├── etc...
│   │         
│   ├── www.staging.my-website.com
│   │    ├── database
│   │    ├── etc...
----
 
Each site (staging, live, or any other website) has its own folder. Within that
we have a separate folder for the source code, the database, and the static
files.  The logic is that, while the source code might change from one version
of the site to the next, the database will stay the same.  The static folder
is in the same relative location, '../static', that we set up at the end of
the last chapter. Finally, the virtualenv gets its own subfolder too.  What's a
virtualenv, I hear you ask? We'll find out shortly.


Adjusting the database location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First let's change the location of our database in 'settings.py', and make sure
we can get that working on our local PC.  I often end up defining a variable
called `PROJECT_ROOT` in 'settings.py' sooner or later:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
[source,python]
----

PROJECT_ROOT = path.join(path.dirname(__file__), '..')

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': path.abspath(path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, '../database/database.sqlite')),
        'USER': '',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
[...]

# Example: "/home/media/media.lawrence.com/static/"
STATIC_ROOT = path.abspath(path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, '../static'))
----

Now let's try it locally:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mkdir ../database*
$ *python manage.py syncdb*
Creating tables ...
[...]
$ ls ../database/
database.sqlite
----

That seems to work.  Let's commit it.

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # should show changes in settings.py
$ *git commit -am"move sqlite database outside of main source tree"
----

To get our code onto the server, we'll use git and go via one of the code
sharing sites.  If you haven't already, push your code up to GitHub, BitBucket
or similar.  They all have excellent instructions for beginners on how to
do that.  

Here's some bash commands that will set this all up. If you're not familiar
with it, note the `export` command which lets me set up a "local variable"
in bash:

    export SITENAME=book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com
    mkdir -p /home/harry/sites/$SITENAME
    mkdir /home/harry/sites/$SITENAME/database
    mkdir /home/harry/sites/$SITENAME/static
    mkdir /home/harry/sites/$SITENAME/virtualenv
    cd ~/sites/$SITENAME
    # you should replace the next line with the URL to your own repo
    git clone https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.git source

Now we've got the site installed, let's just try running the dev server -- this
is a smoke test, to see if all the moving parts are connected:

    $ python manage.py runserver
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "manage.py", line 8, in <module>
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    ImportError: No module named django.core.management

Ah. Django isn't installed on the server. 

Creating a virtualenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We could install it at this point, but that would leave us with a problem:  if
we ever wanted to upgrade Django when a new version comes out, it would be
impossible to test the staging site with a different version from live.
Similarly, if there are other users on the server, we'd all be forced to use
the same version of Django.

The solution is a "virtualenv" -- a neat way of having different versions of
python packages installed in different places, in their own "virtual
environments".

Let's try it out on own PC first:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install virtualenv*
----

We'll follow the same folder structure as we're planning for the server:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *virtualenv ../virtualenv*
$ *source ../virtualenv/bin/activate*
(virtualenv)$ python manage.py test lists
# will show ImportError: No module named django
# because Django isn't installed inside the virtualenv
(virtualenv)$ *pip install django*
[...]
Successfully installed django
Cleaning up...
(virtualenv)$ python manage.py test lists
[...]
OK
----

To "save" the list of packages we need in our virtualenv, and be able to 
re-create it later, we create a 'requirements.txt' file, using `pip freeze`,
and add that to our repository:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
(virtualenv)$ *pip freeze > requirements.txt*
(virtualenv)$ *git add requirements.txt*
(virtualenv)$ *deactivate*
$ *git commit -m"Add requirements.txt for virtualenv"*
----

Next we do a `git push` to send our updates up to our code-sharing site

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git push* 
----

And we can pull those changes down to the server

    $ git pull
    $ virtualenv ../virtualenv/
    (virtualenv)$ source ../virtualenv/bin/activate
    (virtualenv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
    Downloading/unpacking Django==1.5.1 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
    [...]
    (virtualenv)$ python manage.py runserver
    Validating models...
    0 errors found
    [...]

That looks like it worked.  

Simple nginx configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's now go and edit our nginx config to tell it to send requests for our
staging site along to Django. A minimal config looks like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/nginx-staging.conf
[source,nginx]
----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com;

    location /static {
        alias /home/harry/sites/$server_name/static;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    }
}
----

This config says it will only work for our staging domain, it points the web
server to the folder where our static files are, and then it says to "proxy"
all other requests to the local port 8000 where it expects to find Django
waiting to respond to requests.

////
TODO: log files
////

I saved this to a file called 'nginx-staging.conf' inside 'superlists', 
and then added it to the enabled sites for the server by creating
a symlink to it:

   (virtualenv)$ ln -s /home/harry/sites/$SITENAME/source/superlists/nginx-staging.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/$SITENAME

NOTE: I also had to edit '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf' and uncomment a line saying
`server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;` to get my long domain name to work...

And now to test it:

    (virtualenv)$ service nginx reload
    (virtualenv)$ python manage.py runserver

That gets us as far as seeing the site, but static files aren't working:

.Staging site is up!
image::images/staging_is_up.png[Our staging version is live... but looks ugly again]

Let's see what our functional tests say:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com*]
[...]
NoSuchElementException: Message: u'Unable to locate element:
{"method":"id","selector":"id_list_table"}' ; [...]
[...]
AssertionError: 125 != 497 within 3 delta
FAILED (failures=1, errors=1)
----

The tests are telling us that our CSS isn't working, and are also failing
as soon as they try and submit a new item, because we haven't set up the 
database. Let's do those two things now


Deploying static files and the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We run a `collectstatic` and a `syncdb` to set up static files and the
database. The `--noinput` suppresses the two little "are you sure" prompts:

----
(virtualenv)$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
(virtualenv)$ python manage.py syncdb --noinput
(virtualenv)$ ls ../static/
base.css  bootstrap
(virtualenv)$ ls ../database/
database.sqlite
(virtualenv)$ python manage.py runserver
----

Now if you have a look at the site, things are looking much healthier. We
can re-run our FTs:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests --liveserver=book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
..
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 10.718s

OK
----

Hooray!  We're reassured that the piping works, but we really can't be
using the Django dev. server in production.  We also can't be relying
on manually starting it up with `runserver`.

Switching to Gunicorn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do you know why the Django mascot is a pony?  The story is that Django
comes with so many things you want -- an ORM, all sorts of middleware,
the admin site -- "what else do you want, a pony?". Well, Gunicorn stands
for "Green Unicorn", which I guess is what you'd want next if you already
had a pony...

    (virtualenv)$ pip install gunicorn

Gunicorn will need to know a path to a WSGI server, which is usually
a function called `application`.  Django provides one at 'superlists/wsgi.py'.
We can try that out, and check that all the virtualenv magic works too, by
deactivating the virtualenv and seeing if we can still serve our app using
the `gunicorn` executable that pip just put in there for us:


    (virtualenv)$ deactivate
    $ ../virtualenv/bin/gunicorn superlists.wsgi:application
    2013-05-27 16:22:01 [10592] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 0.17.4
    2013-05-27 16:22:01 [10592] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (10592)
    [...]

That looks good!  


Using upstart to make sure gunicorn starts on boot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our final step is to make sure that the server always starts
up gunicorn on boot.  On Ubuntu, the way to do this is using upstart.

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/gunicorn-upstart-staging.conf
[source,upstart]
----
description "Gunicorn server for book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com"

start on net-device-up
stop on shutdown

respawn

chdir /home/harry/sites/book-example-staging.obeythetestinggoat.com/source
exec ../virtualenv/bin/gunicorn superlists.wsgi:application
----

I copied this file into '/etc/init' on the server, calling it
'/etc/init/gunicorn_staging.conf'

Now we can start gunicorn with

    sudo service gunicorn-staging start

And you can even test that the site comes back up if you reboot the server.
