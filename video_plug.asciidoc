I've recorded a http://oreil.ly/1svTFqB[10-part video series to accompany this book].  It covers the

then I encourage you to check it out.  Over and above what's in the book,
it should give you a feel for what the "flow" of TDD is like, flicking between
tests and code, explaining the thought process as we go.
