If the Good Lord had wanted us to enjoy ourselves, he wouldn't have granted us
his precious gift of relentless misery.
______________________________________________________________


Initial setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----
mkvirtualenv tdd-workshop --python=python3
pip install 'django<1.9' selenium
git clone https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.git tdd-workshop
cd tddworkshop
git checkout js-workshop-start
git checkout -b mybranch

python manage.py test
# should show one test failure:
[...]
    self.assertFalse(error.is_displayed())
AssertionError: True is not false
----

If any problems with Selenium not being able to start Firefox,

* Either try switching to Firefox 45 ESR

* Or switch to Chrome (`webdriver.Chrome` in 'base.py', and you'll
  need to download a thing called "chromedriver")


Intro
~~~~~

* Not a Js expert
* Who is familiar with: JavaScript (or never used?), jQuery, jasmine, angular,
 require.js


Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~

* Get a basic js test environment going,
* Meet some of the common js testing challenges
* See how it fits in with a Python TDD cycle



Context and site tour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If needed: recap general superlists stuff:

* concept: to-do lists app
* models, views, templates
* unit tests
* functional tests

New bits: 

* validation errors (not dynamic)
* forms

Then:

* current test failure / today's goals.
  'functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py'



Exercise 1: Get it working!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No need for tests, just hack in some javascript, and see if you can get our
test passing

To run just our test:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests.test_list_item_validation*]
----

Then run all the tests with `manage.py test` to make sure we didn't
break anything.

Do a `git stash` to reset your code when you're done.


Setting Up the Jasmine browser-based test runner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discussion:

* Python's relatively small range of testing tools
* vs Javascript: YUI, jsUnit, QUnit, Mocha, Chutzpah, Karma, Jasmine, 
* And then you need to choose an 'assertion framework' and a
'reporter', and maybe a 'mocking library', and it never ends!
* and it all changes every five minutes.

We'll use http://jasmine.github.io/[Jasmine] because it's already in
use here at the org, and is increasingly popular particularly in the
Angular.js world.  In the book I use QUnit, which is relatively
straighforward and make jQuery easy, but it comes at the expense of
flexibility.  And it's  a bit fuddy-duddy.

Make a directory called 'tests' inside 'lists/static', download the jasmine
release, unzip it, and tidy up the folder structure a little, removing the
example code.  Also create an empty file at 'lists/static/list.js', and
another one at 'lists/static/tests/listSpec.js'.

You should end up with something like this:


----
lists/static
├── base.css
├── bootstrap
│   └── [...]
├── list.js
└── tests
    ├── jasmine-2.5.2
    │   ├── boot.js
    │   ├── console.js
    │   ├── jasmine.css
    │   ├── jasmine_favicon.png
    │   ├── jasmine-html.js
    │   └── jasmine.js
    ├── listSpec.js
    └── SpecRunner.html

----

And then edit 'SpecRunner.html' to tweak the paths for our new folder
structure:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/SpecRunner.html
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>JavaScript unit tests</title>

  <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="jasmine-2.5.2/jasmine_favicon.png">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="jasmine-2.5.2/jasmine.css">
  <script src="jasmine-2.5.2/jasmine.js"></script>
  <script src="jasmine-2.5.2/jasmine-html.js"></script>
  <script src="jasmine-2.5.2/boot.js"></script>

  <script src="../list.js"></script>
  <script src="listSpec.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
</body>
</html>
----

Both 'list.js' and 'listSpec.js' are empty, but we should still see something
like this if you load 'SpecRunner.html' up in a browser:

.Basic Jasmine Spec runner with no specs
image::images/empty_jasmine_specrunner.png["Jasmine Spec Runner with no specs"]


Smoke test
^^^^^^^^^^

Edit 'listSpec.js' and create a "smoke test"

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/listSpec.js
[source,javascript]
----
describe("list js", function() {
  it("should have working maths", function() {
    expect(1 + 1).toEqual(2);
  });
});
----

// harry to live-code this based on copy-paste example from jasmine site?
// explain as we go


And you should see something like this:


.Maths works
image::images/maths_works.png["Jasmine with 1 passing spec"]


And if you deliberately break the test you should get this:

.Maths is broken
image::images/maths_broken.png["Jasmine with 1 failing spec"]



Concepts recap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* "spec files" aka tests
* "source files" ie your real javascript
* "SpecRunner.html" ie the browser-based test runner
    - as we'll see later you can also have a command-line test runner
* smoke test is always a nice way to try out any testing framework.
* Jasmine "BDD" tests:
    * `describe` = test class
    * `it` = test
    * `expect` + `toEqual` = assert



.Basic Jasmine setup: advanced exercises
****************************************

1. Browse the http://jasmine.github.io/2.5/introduction.html[Jasmine docs] to
  learn more about Jasmine

2. Checkout out https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-py[Jasmine-Py], 
  `pip install jasmine`, and see if you can get its alternative test runner
  working

****************************************


Adding jQuery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download from jquery.com and put it in 'lists/static/jquery-3.1.1.min.js' 
(don't worry if you get a slightly different version)


Add it to the SpecRunner

And also add a bit of HTML to represent the form
and its error div which we want to hide:

Now let's use jQuery in our test:

.lists/static/tests/listSpec.js

  it("should be able to use jquery to create and hide things", function() {

Global state:  the key challenge of js testing. Lesson 1: HTML fixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* what happens if we dupe the test?

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
2 specs, 1 failure

list js should be able to run the same test twice
  Expected false to be true.
----


* need some way of re-setting the DOM before each test?
* or we only do things that are non-destructive

--> use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` and jQuery append/remove
--> not only solution!


.HTML fixtures advanced exercise
****************************************

Check out "jasmine-jquery" and "jasmine-fixtures" as alternative ways
of loading fixtures.

****************************************




Testing our actual intended behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace our tests with what we actually want to test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/listSpec.js
[source,javascript]
----
  it("should hide errors on keypress", function() {
    $('#testform input').trigger('keypress');
    expect( $('.has-error').is(':visible') ).toBe(false);
  });
----

And maybe this too?  Always check the negative case!

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/listSpec.js
[source,javascript]
----
  it("should not hide errors unnecessarily", function() {
    expect( $('.has-error').is(':visible') ).toBe(true);
  });
----


The key challenge of js testing. Lesson 2: Execution order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* What's the simplest thing we can do?
* Does your hacked-in implementation from earlier work?
* If not, why not?  Debug with some `console.logs`
* If you didn't already, try an 'jquery-wait-for-document-ready' invocation.
  Does that help?

Tips:

* Be clear on what gets executed when:
* When does our HTML fixture get added?  When do we attach our event listeners?
* Want to ask jQuery what event listeners are attached to an element?

[source,javascript]
----
$._data($('selector')[0], 'events')
----



Building a solution that works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We'll have to bite the bullet and use an initialization function.  It's
a common pattern.

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/listSpec.js
[source,javascript]
----
  it("should hide errors on keypress", function() {
    initialize();
    $('#testform input').trigger('keypress');
    expect( $('.has-error').is(':visible') ).toBe(false);
  });
----

* Get this working
* How can we improve on it?


.JavaScript testing: final advanced challenges
**********************************************

1. Add onclick handler, with fts and unit tests
2. Install jslint or jshint into your editor and get it to check your code.
3. Rewrite everything to not use jQuery
4. Require.js?
5. Skip to REST branch for testing ajax!

**********************************************


Final discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----
git stash show -p
# vs
git diff js-workshop-start
----

Compare our finalised JavaScript with our first hacked-in solution.  Was it
worth it?  If not in the immediate, how might it be worth it in the longer run?



Recap: JavaScript Testing Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* One of the great advantages of Selenium is that it allows you to test that
  your JavaScript really works, just as it tests your Python code.

* There are many JavaScript test running libraries out there.  Jasmine is
  popular with the Angular.js crowd.  QUnit is a nice simple one if you're
  only using jQuery

* No matter which testing library you use, you'll always need to find solutions
  to the main challenge of JavaScript testing, which is about 'managing global
  state'.  That includes:
    - the DOM / HTML fixtures
    - namespacing
    - understanding and controlling execution order.

* I don't really mean it when I say that JavaScript is awful. It can actually
  be quite fun.  But I'll say it again: make sure you've read
  <<jsgoodparts,'JavaScript: The Good Parts'>>.
