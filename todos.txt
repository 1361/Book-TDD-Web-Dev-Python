keeptogether stuff

- fix small-code asciidoc source stuff (quick task)
- final decision on the "praise" chapter -- I think we'll probably just drop this.  In fact, let's just say we will drop it.
- rewrite a few paragraphs in chapter 16 (will watch out for anything that might interfere with indexing)
- see how the new "scratchpad" formatting is looking in the pdf + on chimera. liaise with tools if necessary.
- integrate my acknowledgements chapter, and see how it looks in the pdf.  (it's up there now, if you're curious). may need a couple of tweaks
- if django 1.7 is officially released, we'll need to make a few small changes to installation instructions in about 3 places.
