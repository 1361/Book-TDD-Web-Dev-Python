Web development 'sine qua non'\'s
=================================

Now that we've got some of the basics of TDD and web development under 
our belts, let's start to venture out into some of the trickier but unavoidable
aspects of web development: static files, deployment to production, form data
validation, database migrations, and the dreaded JavaScript. Along the way,
I'll show how TDD can help us to get these things right.

In this section, I'm still trying to keep the learning curve relatively 
soft, but we will meet several major new concepts and technologies. I'll only
be able to dip lightly into each one -- I hope to demonstrate enough of each
to get you started when you get to your own project, but you will also find
yourself needing to do your own reading around when you start to apply these
topics to your own projects.
