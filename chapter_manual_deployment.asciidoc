______________________________________________________________
Is all fun and game until you are need of put it in production.
______________________________________________________________



((("deployment", "testing using staging sites", id="DEPstage09")))It's time to deploy the first version of our site and make it public.  They say
that if you wait until you feel ready to ship, then you've waited too long.

Is our site usable?  Is it better than nothing? Can we make lists on it? Yes,
yes, yes.

No, you can't log in yet.  No, you can't mark tasks as completed.  But do we
really need any of that stuff? Not really--and you can never be sure what
your users are 'actually' going to do with your site once they get their 
hands on it. We think our users want to use the site for to-do lists, but maybe
they actually want to use it to make "top 10 best fly-fishing spots" lists, for
which you don't need any kind of ``mark completed'' function. We won't know
until we put it out there.

In this chapter we're going to go through and actually deploy our site to a
real, live web server.  

You might be tempted to skip this chapter--there's lots of daunting stuff
in it, and maybe you think this isn't what you signed up for. But I 'strongly' 
urge you to give it a go.  This is one of the sections of the book I'm most
pleased with, and it's one that people often write to me saying they were
really glad they stuck through it. 

If you've never done a server deployment before, it will demystify a whole
world for you, and there's nothing like the feeling of seeing your site live on
the actual internet. Give it a buzzword name like "DevOps" if that's what it
takes to convince you it's worth it.

NOTE: Why not ping me a note once your site is live on the web, and send me
    the URL? It always gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling...

TDD and the Danger Areas of Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("staging sites", "benefits of")))Deploying a site to a live web server can be a tricky topic.  Oft-heard is the
forlorn cry __"but it works on my machine!"__


((("deployment", "danger areas of")))Some of the danger areas of deployment include:

Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)::
    ((("static files", "challenges of")))Web servers usually need special configuration for serving these.
    

The database:: 
    There can be permissions and path issues, and we need to be careful about
    preserving data between deploys.
    

Dependencies:: 
    We need to make sure that the packages our software relies on are installed
    on the server, and have the correct versions.
    
    

But there are solutions to all of these.  In order:

*   Using a 'staging site', on the same infrastructure as the production site,
    can help us test out our deployments and get things right before we go to
    the "real" site.
    

*   We can also 'run our functional tests against the staging site'. That will
    reassure us that we have the right code and packages on the server, and
    since we now have a "smoke test" for our site layout, we'll know that the
    CSS is loaded correctly.
    

*   ((("virtual environment (virtualenv)", "server-based")))Just like on our own PC, a 'virtualenv' is useful on the server for
    managing packages and dependencies when you might be running more than one
    Python [keep-together]#application#.
    

*   ((("automated deployment", "benefits of")))((("automated deployment", see="also Fabric")))And finally, 'automation, automation, automation'.  By using an automated
    script to deploy new versions, and by using the same script to deploy to
    staging [keep-together]#and production#, we can reassure ourselves that staging is as much
    like live as
    [keep-together]#possible#.footnote:[What I'm calling a "staging" server, some people would
    call a "development" server, and some others would also like to distinguish
    "preproduction" servers.  Whatever we call it, the point is to have
    somewhere we can try our code out in an environment that's as similar as
    possible to the real production server.] 
    
     

Over the next few pages I'm going to go through 'a' deployment procedure.  It 
isn't meant to be the 'perfect' deployment procedure, so please don't take
it as being best practice, or a recommendation--it's meant to be an
illustration, to show the kinds of issues involved in deployment and where
testing fits in.


.Deployment Chapters Overview
*******************************************************************************


There's lots of stuff in the next three chapters, so here's an overview to help you
keep your bearings:

**This chapter: getting it up and running**

* Adapt our FTs so they can run against a staging server.

* Spin up a server, install all the required software on it, and point our
  staging and live domains at it.

* Upload our code to the server using Git.

* Try and get a quick-and-dirty version of our site running on the staging domain
  using the Django dev server.

* Manually set up a virtualenv on the server (without `virtualenvwrapper`), and
  make sure the database and static files are working.

* As we go, we'll keep running our FT, to tell us what's working and what's
  not.


**Next chapter: moving to a production-ready config**

* Move from our quick-and-dirty version to a production-ready configuration;
  stop using the Django dev server, set our app to start automatically on
  boot, set +DEBUG+ to +False+, and so on.


**Third deployment chapter: automating the deployment**

. Once we have a working config, we'll write a script to automate the process
  we've just been through manually, so that we can deploy our site
  automatically in future.

. Finally we'll use this script to deploy the production version of our site
  on its real domain.

*******************************************************************************



As Always, Start with a Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



((("staging sites", "adapting functional tests for", id="SSadapt09")))Let's adapt our functional tests slightly so that it can be run against
a staging site. We'll do it by slightly hacking an argument that is normally
used to change the address which the test's temporary server gets run on:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py (ch08l001)
====
[source,python]
----
import os
[...]

class NewVisitorTest(StaticLiveServerTestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.browser = webdriver.Firefox()
        staging_server = os.environ.get('STAGING_SERVER')  #<1>
        if staging_server:
            self.live_server_url = 'http://' + staging_server  #<2>
----
====


Do you remember I said that `LiveServerTestCase` had certain limitations?
Well, one is that it always assumes you want to use its own test server, which
it makes available at `self.live_server_url`.  I still want to be able to do
that sometimes, but I also want to be able to selectively tell it not to
bother, and to use a real server instead.

<1> The way I decided to do it is using an environment variable called
    `STAGING_SERVER`.

<2> Here's the hack: we replace `self.live_server_url` with the address of
    our "real" server.

We test that said hack hasn't broken anything by running the functional
tests [keep-together]#"normally"#:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests*] 
[...]
Ran 3 tests in 8.544s

OK
----

And now we can try them against our staging server URL.  I'm planning to 
host my staging server at 'superlists-staging.ottg.eu':


//would need to reset DNS each time for this test to work

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]

Ran 3 tests in 19.480s:

FAILED (failures=3)
----

NOTE: If, on Windows, you see an error saying something like 
    "STAGING_SERVER is not recognized as a command", it's probably because
    you're not using Git-Bash.  Take another look at the &#x201c;<<pre-requisites>>&#x201d; section.

You can see that both tests are failing, as expected, since I haven't
actually set up my domain yet. In fact, you can see from the first traceback
that the test is actually ending up on the home page of my domain registrar.

((("", startref="SSadapt09")))The FT seems to be testing the right things though, so let's commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # should show changes to functional_tests.py
$ *git commit -am "Hack FT runner to be able to test staging"*
----


TIP: Don't use `export` to set the 'STAGING_SERVER' environment variable;
    otherwise, all your subsequent test runs in that terminal will be against
    staging (and that can be very confusing if you're not expecting it).
    Setting it explicitly inline each time you run the FTs is best.


Getting a Domain Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




((("staging sites", "domain names")))((("domain names")))We're going to need a couple of domain names at this point in the book--they
can both be subdomains of a single domain.  I'm going to use
'superlists.ottg.eu' and 'superlists-staging.ottg.eu'.
If you don't already own a domain, this is the time to register one! Again,
this is something I really want you to 'actually' do.  If you've never
registered a domain before, just pick any old registrar and buy a cheap one--it
should only cost you $5 or so, and you can even find free ones.
I promise seeing your site on a "real" website will be a thrill.


Manually Provisioning a Server to Host Our Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





((("staging sites", "manual server provisioning", id="SSserver09")))((("server provisioning", id="seerver09")))We can separate out "deployment" into two tasks:

- 'Provisioning' a new server to be able to host the code
- 'Deploying' a new version of the code to an existing server

Some people like to use a brand new server for every deployment--it's what we
do at PythonAnywhere.  That's only necessary for larger, more complex sites
though, or major changes to an existing site. For a simple site like ours, it
makes sense to separate the two tasks.  And, although we eventually want both
to be completely automated, we can probably live with a manual provisioning
system for now.

As you go through this chapter, you should be aware that provisioning is
something that varies a lot, and that as a result there are few universal
best practices for deployment.  So, rather than trying to remember the 
specifics of what I'm doing here, you should be trying to understand the
rationale, so that you can apply the same kind of thinking in the
specific future circumstances you encounter.


Choosing Where to Host Our Site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


((("hosting services")))There are loads of different solutions out there these days, but they broadly
fall into two camps:

- Running your own (possibly virtual) server
- Using a ((("Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS)")))Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS) offering like Heroku, OpenShift, or
  [keep-together]#PythonAnywhere#




((("PythonAnywhere")))Particularly for small sites, a PaaS offers a lot of advantages, and I would
definitely recommend looking into them.  We're not going to use a PaaS in this
book however, for several reasons.  Firstly, I have a conflict of interest, in
that I think PythonAnywhere is the best, but then again I would say that
because I work there.  Secondly, all the PaaS offerings are quite different,
and the procedures to deploy to each vary a lot--learning about one doesn't
necessarily tell you about the others. Any one of them might change their
process radically, or simply go out of business by the time you get to read
this book.

Instead, we'll learn just a tiny bit of good old-fashioned server admin,
including SSH and web server config.  They're unlikely to ever go away, and
knowing a bit about them will get you some respect from all the grizzled
dinosaurs out there.

What I have done is to try to set up a server in such a way that it's a lot
like the environment you get from a PaaS, so you should be able to apply the
lessons we learn in the deployment section, no matter what provisioning
solution you choose.


Spinning Up a Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



I'm not going to
dictate how you do this--whether you choose Amazon AWS, Rackspace, Digital
Ocean, your own server in your own data centre or a Raspberry Pi in a cupboard
under the stairs, any solution should be fine, as long as:

* Your server is running Ubuntu 16.04 (aka "Xenial/LTS").

* You have root access to it.

* It's on the public internet.

* You can SSH into it.

I'm recommending Ubuntu as a distro because it's easy to get Python 3.6 on it
and it has some specific ways of configuring Nginx, which I'm going to make use
of next.  If you know what you're doing, you can probably get away with using
something else, but you're on your own.

((("Linux servers")))If you've never started a Linux server before and you have absolutely no idea
where to start, I wrote a
https://github.com/hjwp/Book-TDD-Web-Dev-Python/blob/master/server-quickstart.md[very brief guide on GitHub].


NOTE: ((("getting help")))Some people get to this chapter, and are tempted to skip the domain bit,
    and the "getting a real server" bit, and just use a VM on their own PC.
    Don't do this. It's 'not' the same, and you'll have more difficulty
    following the instructions, which are complicated enough as it is.  If
    you're worried about cost, dig around and you'll find free options for
    both. Email me if you need further pointers; I'm always happy to help.


User Accounts, SSH, and Privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In these instructions, I'm assuming that you have a nonroot user account set
up that has "sudo" privileges, so whenever we need to do something that
requires root access, we use sudo, and I'm explicit about that in the various
instructions that follow. 

My user is called "elspeth", but you can call yours whatever you like!


Installing Nginx 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


((("Nginx", "installation")))We'll need a web server, and all the cool kids are using Nginx these days,
so we will too.  Having fought with Apache for many years, I can tell
you it's a blessed relief in terms of the readability of its config files,
if nothing else!

Installing Nginx on my server was a matter of doing an `apt-get`, and I could
then see the default Nginx "Hello World" screen:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt-get install nginx*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl start nginx*
----

(You may need to do an `apt-get update` and/or an `apt-get upgrade` first.)

TIP: Look out for that `elspeth@server` in the command-line listings in this
    chapter. It indicates commands that must be run on the server, as opposed
    to commands you run on your own PC.


You should be able to go to the IP address of your server, and see the
"Welcome to nginx" page at this point, as in <<nginx-it-works>>.

TIP: If you don't see it, it may be because your firewall does not open port 80
    to the world. On AWS, for example, you may need to configure the "security
    group" for your server to open port 80.

[[nginx-it-works]]
.Nginx--it works!
image::images/twp2_0901.png["The default 'Welcome to nginx!' page"]


Installing Python 3.6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Python 3", "installation and setup", "on staging sites", tertiary-sortas="staging sites")))Python 3.6 wasn't available in the standard repositories on Ubuntu at the
time of writing, but the user-contributed
https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/ubuntu/deadsnakes["Deadsnakes PPA"]
has it.  Here's how we install it:


While we've got root access, let's make sure the server has the key
pieces of software we need at the system level: Python, Git, pip, and virtualenv.

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt-get update*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3.6-venv*
----

And while we're at it, we'll just make sure Git is installed too.

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt-get install git*
----


Configuring Domains for Staging and Live
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We don't want to be messing about with IP addresses all the time, so we should
point our staging and live domains to the server. At my registrar, the control
screens looked a bit like <<registrar-control-screens>>.

[[registrar-control-screens]]
.Domain setup
image::images/twp2_0902.png["Registrar control screens for two domains"]

//TODO: adjust illustration to show "superlists" not "book-example"

((("A-Records")))In the DNS system, pointing a domain at a specific IP address is called an
"A-Record".  All registrars are slightly different, but a bit of clicking
around should get you to the right screen in yours.



Using the FT to Confirm the Domain Works and Nginx Is Running
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



((("Nginx", "confirming operation of")))To confirm  this works, we can rerun our functional tests and see that their
failure messages have changed slightly--one of them in particular should
now mention Nginx:

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*STAGING_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_new_item"]
[...]
AssertionError: 'To-Do' not found in 'Welcome to nginx!'
----

((("", startref="SSserver09")))((("", startref="seerver09")))Progress!  Give yourself a pat on the back, and maybe a nice cup of tea
and a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_biscuit[Chocolate biscuit].







Deploying Our Code Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("staging sites", "manual code deployment", id="SScode09")))The next step is to get a copy of the staging site up and running, just to
check whether we can get Nginx and Django to talk to each other.  As we do so,
we're starting to move into doing "deployment" rather than provisioning, so we
should be thinking about how we can automate the process as we go.

NOTE: One rule of thumb for distinguishing provisioning from deployment is
    that you tend to need root permissions for the former, but you don't for the
    latter.
    
    

We need a directory for the source to live in.  We'll put it somewhere
in the home folder of our nonroot user; in my case it would be at
'/home/elspeth' (this is likely to be the setup on any shared hosting system,
but you should always run your web apps as a nonroot user, in any case). I'm
going to set up my sites like this:

[role="skipme"]
----
/home/elspeth
├── sites
│   ├── www.live.my-website.com
│   │    ├── database
│   │    │     └── db.sqlite3
│   │    ├── source
│   │    │    ├── manage.py
│   │    │    ├── superlists
│   │    │    ├── etc...
│   │    │
│   │    ├── static
│   │    │    ├── base.css
│   │    │    ├── etc...
│   │    │
│   │    └── virtualenv
│   │         ├── lib
│   │         ├── etc...
│   │
│   ├── www.staging.my-website.com
│   │    ├── database
│   │    ├── etc...
----

Each site (staging, live, or any other website) has its own folder. Within that
we have a separate folder for the source code, the database, and the static
files.  The logic is that, while the source code might change from one version
of the site to the next, the database will stay the same.  The static folder
is in the same relative location, '../static', that we set up at the end of
the last chapter. Finally, the virtualenv gets its own subfolder too (on the
server, there's no need to use `virtualenvwrapper`; we'll create a virtualenv
manually).


Adjusting the Database Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



First let's change the location of our database in 'settings.py', and make sure
we can get that working on our local PC:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch08l003)
====
[source,python]
----
# Build paths inside the project like this: os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ...)
import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
[...]

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '../database/db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
----
====

TIP: Check out the way `BASE_DIR` is defined, further up in 'settings.py'.
    Notice the `abspath` gets done first (i.e., innermost).  Always follow this
    pattern when path wrangling; otherwise, you can see strange things happening
    depending on how the file is imported.  Thanks to
    https://github.com/CleanCut/green[Green Nathan] for that tip!


Now let's try it locally:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mkdir ../database*
$ *python manage.py migrate --noinput*
Operations to perform:
Apply all migrations: auth, contenttypes, lists, sessions
Running migrations:
[...]
$ *ls ../database/*
db.sqlite3
----

That seems to work.  Let's commit it:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # should show changes in settings.py
$ *git commit -am "move sqlite database outside of main source tree"*
----

To get our code onto the server, we'll use Git and go via one of the code-sharing sites.  If you haven't already, push your code up to GitHub, BitBucket,
or similar.  They all have excellent instructions for beginners on how to
do that.


((("Git", "local variables")))Here are some bash commands that will set this all up. If you're not familiar
with it, note the `export` command which lets me set up a "local variable"
in bash:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs=""]
----
elspeth@server:$ <strong>export SITENAME=superlists-staging.ottg.eu</strong>
elspeth@server:$ <strong>mkdir -p ~/sites/$SITENAME/database</strong>
elspeth@server:$ <strong>mkdir -p ~/sites/$SITENAME/static</strong>
elspeth@server:$ <strong>mkdir -p ~/sites/$SITENAME/virtualenv</strong>
# you should replace the URL in the next line with the URL for your own repo
elspeth@server:$ <strong>git clone https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.git \
~/sites/$SITENAME/source</strong>
Resolving deltas: 100% [...]
----

NOTE: A bash variable defined using `export` only lasts as long as that console
    session. If you log out of the server and log back in again, you'll need to
    redefine it. It's devious because Bash won't error, it will just substitute
    the empty string for the variable, which will lead to weird results...if in
    doubt, do a quick *`echo $SITENAME`*.

Now we've got the site installed, let's just try running the dev server--this
is a smoke test, to see if all the moving parts are connected:

[role="skipme"]
[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ $ *cd ~/sites/$SITENAME/source*
$ *python manage.py runserver*
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "manage.py", line 8, in <module>
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
ImportError: No module named django.core.management
----
//cant test this because we hack runservers using dtach

Ah. Django isn't installed on the server.


Creating a Virtualenv Manually, and Using requirements.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


((("requirements.txt")))((("virtual environment (virtualenv)", "creating manually")))To "save" the list of packages we need in our virtualenv, and be able to
re-create it on the server, we create a 'requirements.txt' file:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *echo "django==1.11" > requirements.txt*
$ *git add requirements.txt*
$ *git commit -m "Add requirements.txt for virtualenv"*
----

NOTE: You may be wondering why we didn't add our other dependency,
    Selenium, to our requirements.  The reason is that Selenium is
    only a dependency for the tests, not the application code.  Some
    people like to also create a file called 'test-requirements.txt'.

Now we do a `git push` to send our updates up to our code-sharing site:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git push*
----

And we can pull those changes down to the server: 

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *git pull*  # may ask you to do some git config first
----


Creating a virtualenv "manually" (i.e., without `virtualenvwrapper`) involves
using the standard library "venv" module, and specifying the path you
want the virtualenv to go in:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *pwd*
/home/espeth/sites/staging.superlists.com/source
elspeth@server:$ *python3.6 -m venv ../virtualenv*
elspeth@server:$ *ls ../virtualenv/bin*
activate      activate.fish  easy_install-3.6  pip3    python
activate.csh  easy_install   pip               pip3.6  python3
----

If we wanted to activate the virtualenv, we could do so with
`source ../virtualenv/bin/activate`, but we don't need to do
that.  We can actually do everything we want to by calling the versions
of Python, pip, and the other executables in the virtualenv's 'bin'
directory, as we'll see.

To install our requirements into the virtualenv, we use the virtualenv
pip:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt*
Downloading/unpacking Django==1.11 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
[...]
Successfully installed Django
----


And to run Python in the virtualenv, we use the virtualenv `python`
binary:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/python manage.py runserver*
Validating models...
0 errors found
[...]
----

TIP: Depending on your firewall configuration, you may even be able to manually
    visit your site at this point. You'll need to run `runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
    to listen on the public as well as private IP address, and then go to
    'http://your.domain.com:8000'.

//TODO: could bind to port 80 using sudo and see some tests pass?

That looks like it's running happily.  We can Ctrl-C it for now.


More progress!  We've got a system for getting code to and from the server (`git push` and `git pull`), and we've got a virtualenv set up to match our local one, and
a single file, 'requirements.txt', to keep them in sync.


Next we'll configure the Nginx web server to talk to Django and get our site
up on the standard port 80.

   

Simple Nginx Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



((("Nginx", "configuring")))We create an Nginx config file to tell it to send requests for our staging
site along to Django. A minimal config looks like this:

[role="sourcecode"]
.server: /etc/nginx/sites-available/superlists-staging.ottg.eu
====
[source,nginx]
----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name superlists-staging.ottg.eu;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    }
}
----
====

This config says it will only listen for our staging domain, and will "proxy"
all requests to the local port 8000 where it expects to find Django
waiting to respond.

I saved this to a file called 'superlists-staging.ottg.eu'
inside the '/etc/nginx/sites-available' folder.

NOTE: Not sure how to edit a file on the server?  There's always vi, which I'll
    keep encouraging you to learn a bit of, but perhaps today is already too
    full of new things. Try the relatively beginner-friendly 
    http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/[`nano`]
    instead. Note you'll also need to use `sudo` because the file is in a
    system folder.

We then add it to the enabled sites for the server by creating a symlink to it:

[role="server-commands small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *echo $SITENAME* # check this still has our site in
superlists-staging.ottg.eu
elspeth@server:$ *sudo ln -s ../sites-available/$SITENAME /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/$SITENAME*
elspeth@server:$ *ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled* # check our symlink is there
----

That's the Debian/Ubuntu preferred way of saving Nginx configurations--the real
config file in 'sites-available', and a symlink in 'sites-enabled'; the idea is
that it makes it easier to switch sites on or off.

We also may as well remove the default "Welcome to nginx" config, to avoid any
[keep-together]#confusion#:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default*
----

And now to test it:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl reload nginx*
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/python manage.py runserver*
----

NOTE: I also had to edit '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf' and uncomment a line saying
    `server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;` to get my long domain name to work.
    You may not have this problem; Nginx will warn you when you do a `reload`
    if it has any trouble with its config files.

A quick visual inspection confirms--the site is up (<<staging-is-up>>)!

[[staging-is-up]]
.The staging site is up!
image::images/twp2_0903.png["The front page of the site, at least, is up"]

TIP: ((("Nginx", "troubleshooting")))((("troubleshooting", "Nginx operation")))If you ever find Nginx isn't behaving as expected, try the command
    `sudo nginx -t`, which does a config test, and will warn you of any 
    problems in your configuration files.


Let's see what our functional tests say:

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*STAGING_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
[...]
AssertionError: 0.0 != 512 within 3 delta
----



The tests are failing as soon as they try to submit a new item, because we
haven't set up the database. You'll probably have spotted the yellow Django
debug page (<<django-debug-screen>>) telling us as much as the tests went
through, or if you tried it manually.



[[django-debug-screen]]
.But the database isn't
image::images/twp2_0904.png["Django DEBUG page showing database error"]

NOTE: The tests saved us from potential embarrassment there.  The site 'looked'
    fine when we loaded its front page.  If we'd been a little hasty, we might
    have thought we were done, and it would have been the first users that
    discovered that nasty Django DEBUG page.  Okay, slight exaggeration for
    effect, maybe we 'would' have checked, but what happens as the site gets
    bigger and more complex? You can't check everything. The tests can.
    
    



Creating the Database with migrate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



((("database migrations")))We run `migrate` using the `--noinput` argument to suppress the two little "are
you sure" prompts:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/python manage.py migrate --noinput*
Creating tables ...
[...]
elspeth@server:$ *ls ../database/*
db.sqlite3
elspeth@server:$ *../virtualenv/bin/python manage.py runserver*
----

Let's try the FTs again:

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*STAGING_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]

...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 10.718s

OK
----

It's great to see the site up and running!  We might reward ourselves with a
well-earned tea break at this point, before moving on to the next section...

TIP: If you see a "502 - Bad Gateway", it's probably because you forgot to
    restart the dev server with `manage.py runserver` after the `migrate`.


There are a few more debugging tips in the sidebar that follows.


.Server Debugging Tips
*******************************************************************************
((("server provisioning")))((("debugging", "server provisioning")))Deployments are tricky!  If ever things don't go exactly as expected, here are
a few tips and things to look out for:


- I'm sure you already have, but double-check that each file is exactly where
  it should be and has the right contents--a single stray character can make
  all the difference.

- Nginx error logs go into '/var/log/nginx/error.log'.

- You can ask Nginx to "check" its config using the `-t` flag: `nginx -t`

- Make sure your browser isn't caching an out-of-date response.  Use
  Ctrl-Refresh, or start a new private browser window.

- This may be clutching at straws, but I've sometimes seen inexplicable
  behaviour on the server that's only been resolved when I fully restarted it
  with a `sudo reboot`.

((("", startref="SScode09")))If you ever get completely stuck, there's always the option of blowing away
your server and starting again from scratch!  It should go faster the second
time...

Success!  Our Hack Deployment Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Phew.  Assuming you managed to get that up and running, we are at least
reassured that the basic piping works, but we really can't be using the Django
dev server in production.  We also can't be relying on
manually starting it up with `runserver`.  In the next chapter, we'll
make our hacky deployment more production-ready.((("", startref="DEPstage09")))



.Test-Driving Server Configuration and Deployment 
*******************************************************************************

Tests take some of the uncertainty out of deployment::
    ((("staging sites", "benefits of")))For developers, server administration is always "fun", by which I mean, a
    process full of uncertainty and surprises. My aim during this chapter was
    to show that a functional test suite can take some of the uncertainty out of the
    process.  
    
    

Typical pain points--database, static files, dependencies, custom settings::
    The things that you need to keep an eye out for on any deployment include
    your database configuration, static files, software dependencies, and
    custom settings that differ between development and production.  You'll
    need to think through each of these for your own deployments.

Tests allow us to experiment::
    Whenever we make a change to our server configuration, we can rerun the
    test suite, and be confident that everything works as well as it did
    before.  It allows us to experiment with our setup with less fear (as
    we'll see in the next chapter).
