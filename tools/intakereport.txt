    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master

Notes from Dan:
==================


Please adjust oneoff.css to break the title page. Some of the chapter titles should be given some attention w/r/t line breaking.

Authors have included "Prerequisites and Assumptions" section after the Preface. I think it works well as front matter, and like how they've done it. It's not altogether standard, so just calling it out as okay. 

Long code lines in the sidebar "Reading tracebacks" in Chapter 3. There are long code lines throughout. Chapter 9 is especially bad.

Part II starts with an attributed quote. The quoted text is short and the overall rendering looks artless. Please adjust the oneoff.css to push the quotes farther to right. Or maybe make the quoted text flush right? As I flip through, I see several short quotes. Something must be done.

Note about copyediting from Meg:  Author has a personality that comes through strongly in his writing, I don't want that eradicated. He also feels pretty strongly about his British phrases and such staying - any way we can wrangle that?

In "epilogue.asciidoc," I fixed a broken x-ref as follows (check with the author to make sure changes are correct):

Before:
Another area that takes real hard work is continuous integration.  You saw in
the [[CI-chapter]] that strange and unpredictable bugs sometimes occur on CI.

After:
Another area that takes real hard work is continuous integration.  You saw in
<<CI-chapter>> that strange and unpredictable bugs sometimes occur on CI.

The author includes a note in the Preface about readers using the Chimera version. We should remove this from the final production version. Please confirm with the author.

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,

Dan
