   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo in Git.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** Syntax highlighting: applied to 530 out of 1077 code listings.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.


Notes from Dan:
==================


Please adjust oneoff.css to break the title page. Some of the chapter titles should be given some attention w/r/t line breaking.

Authors have included "Prerequisites and Assumptions" section after the Preface. I think it works well as front matter, and like how they've done it. It's not altogether standard, so just calling it out as okay. 

Long code lines in the sidebar "Reading tracebacks" in Chapter 3. There are long code lines throughout. Chapter 9 is especially bad.

Part II starts with an attributed quote. The quoted text is short and the overall rendering looks artless. Please adjust the oneoff.css to push the quotes farther to right. Or maybe make the quoted text flush right? As I flip through, I see several short quotes. Something must be done.

Note about copyediting from Meg:  Author has a personality that comes through strongly in his writing, I don't want that eradicated. He also feels pretty strongly about his British phrases and such staying - any way we can wrangle that?

In "epilogue.asciidoc," I fixed a broken x-ref as follows (check with the author to make sure changes are correct):

Before:
Another area that takes real hard work is continuous integration.  You saw in
the [[CI-chapter]] that strange and unpredictable bugs sometimes occur on CI.

After:
Another area that takes real hard work is continuous integration.  You saw in
<<CI-chapter>> that strange and unpredictable bugs sometimes occur on CI.

The author includes a note in the Preface about readers using the Chimera version. We should remove this from the final production version. Please confirm with the author.

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,

Dan


Notes from Harry, the Author
============================

With permission from Melanie Y, I'm pushing up some changes to Atlas.  I know
this is annoying for you guys, I've tried to do things in a way that will 
provide minimal suprises.  Here are the new commits:

    af1f03f (HEAD, master) todos in 4 and 6 re diagrams, and a couple of extra thanks
    1485d51 tweak filename paths in get_stats
    943268f tweak some wording in 19
    fa29794 fix some typos in 19
    9f89c6e updates to macos instructions for 34
    9b75249 update installation instructions for 3.4
    8766a87 feed thru 3.4 stuff up to chap 20, excluding 19
    31a251f Another rewrite of chapter 19 to make gary happy
    e91dcd2 tweaks for 3.4 into 5 and 6, and their repos
    0e11200 python3.4 in chapter 3
    439403f upgrade chap 1 to 34
    59c181a more on 19 rewrite
    5b46735 start on (hopefully) final 21 rewrite
    30976b1 temporarily reset line endings to unix
    0e86673 new commit id for 21 sources
    1368698 suggested bugfix for windows ugly traceback things
    b0010a6 update todos and wordcount
    0974029 fix wrong commit id for 18 sources
    5fcd412 (atlas/master) Made changes to pre-requisite-installations.asciidoc  <-- last ORM commit

The commits are basically two things:
* upgrading to Python 3.4.  The major effect is on the pre-requistes chapter.
  Other changes are fairly minor tweaks to listings, almost nothing in body
  text
* rewriting chapter 19.  this only affects chapter 19.

Things seemed to have merged cleanly, although I had to revert pre-reqs and
preface to using Unix line-endings to avoid confusing git.  feel free to change
them back. Charles (copy-editor?) and I will coordinate re the changes to the
pre-reqs chapter.

Some comments on Dan + Tools' notes.

- re long code listings, Charles has also been picking up on them.  Several are
  just a few characters over, I'd like to keep them as-is if poss.  Re chapter
  9, the listings are just indicative and it doesn't matter that they should
  be perfect.  We can just cut them off at 80 chars if necessary.

- re syntax highlighting, there are some listings in chapter 15 (eg see my TODO
  in source) where the syntax highlighting works OK on my machine, but isn't
  coming through in the pdfs.  I've emailed tools about it, I think there's a
  support ticket open. It may be to do with different versions of pygments or
  asciidoc?

- I've also got an outstanding request for some custom formatting for the 
  "scratchpad" bits (they're marked with role="scratchpad").  Any update
  on that?

Thansk everyone for your hard work.  Please don't hesitate to email me directly
with queries.  hjwp2@cantab.net
